Prison gangs have a de facto negotiation system to defuse potential conflicts , black gang members said .
Nor does it count many street gangs , whose members may loosely organize behind bars .
Those are the 1976 Guajardo case which resulted in a ruling that allowed gang members at different prisons to freely write each other ; the 1979 LaMar ruling that desegregated prison cells , exacerbating the racial tensions common in prisons everywhere ; and a 1982 court order in the Ruiz prison reform lawsuit which abolished the building tender system .
And in prison , where blacks make up the largest group , white inmates , who perceive they have lost social status because they are suddenly a racial minority , the blame is often placed on blacks , she said .
The plaintiffs also alleged that offenders , regardless of color or `` personal tastes , characteristics , vocabulary , humor , behavior or language '' were crowded together into small cells or dormitories where racial and personal conflicts are aggravated and often flare into violence and that `` fractious militants '' of ethnic groups frequently fight and that blacks rape white prisoners .
`` There was a time when most of the gang members in Texas prisons were gang members who had joined in prison .
But now the street gang members who are being incarcerated actually outnumber what we were historically calling prison gang members . ''
Crips members , who did not want to be identified , note that even white supremacist groups like the Aryan Brotherhood generally refrain from collective attacks on blacks .
`` If they respect us , we respect them , '' one Crip said .
If members of rival gangs tangle over a personal issue , in theory the isolated combatants are permitted to resolve their differences without gang interference .
The members of the Crips agree they would die for their gang , and some would be willing to kill .

Two men were convicted Monday of abducting and killing two young women and wounding a third woman as part of a gang initiation .
Prosecutors said Queen , Tirado and other members of the Crips gang randomly picked the women as part of an initiation ritual in 1998 .
ROUND ROCK , Texas _ Fearful that a gang called the Bloods would terrorize the town and her students , too , the principal of Round Rock High School decided one day to ban the color red .
Red was the gang 's color , said Sherry Blackett , the new principal of the town 's largest high school .
Red was the color of violence .
Red was a color she connected with the town 's first drive -by shooting late last month , the vandalism of a school art project one week later and frequent fights among students .
`` I 'm trying to create an environment that will not allow gangs to flourish , so I banned the color red , '' she said .
The principal , who spent most of her career in Corpus Christi , Texas , added that she knew of kids killed for wearing gang colors .
Red 's a good color , '' said Andrea Miller , a sophomore .
`` For somebody like me to have a color banned from my wardrobe is really kind of silly .
Indeed , local police have identified at least six colors associated with gangs , including the color maroon , which is one of the school colors of Round Rock High .
Hampton said the vandalism at the school , the defacing of artwork , did not appear gang -related , in spite of the fact that it was carried out with red spray paint .
`` I would say this is not a case of gang graffiti , '' said Sgt .
Jack Abbott , gang specialist for the Round Rock police force .
`` That was n't the purpose of the shooting , because of the color red , '' he said .
Abbott said Blackett did n't consult with police before connecting either incident to a gang that wears red or connecting the separate crimes to each other , a point that annoys Debbie Weaver , a parent whose son was sent home from school for wearing red in protest of the ban .
`` He thinks he ought to be able to wear whatever color he wants and I agree , '' she said .
`` You should n't punish the kids for something that may or may not happen , and banning a color is silly .
Are we advertising gang colors by flying our flags outside the school ? ''
What bothers her most , she said , is it appeared to be a selective color ban aimed at minority students .

If people just know the Limp Bizkit name or maybe just heard a tune , that 's cool , says Durst .
More music to our ears : The Jacksonville band Limp Bizkit is n't happy being merely a best-selling rap metal group with a hit album .
The group 's DJ Lethal is now a member of Limp Bizkit .
Just then , on the tape , Durst , enraged that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit video , threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a staff member .
`` Dude , I want to be massive , '' Durst says in the August issue of Spin magazine .
Born in Jacksonville , Fla . , Durst grew up in Gastonia , N.C . , where his love of hip-hop music and break dancing made him an outcast .
They made a demo and sent it to a member of the band Korn , who had gotten a tattoo from Durst while touring in Florida .
Eminem 's dramatic entrance came a few hours after a gay rights group protested his violent lyrics outside Radio City Music Hall .
And they 're not the only ones seeking words of wisdom from the 49-year-old singer-songwriter , the once and future leader of Black Sabbath , the man whose name and legend sit atop the multi-band bash that is Ozzfest '98 , a cavalcade that comes to Great Woods Tuesday and Thursday .
Another expat Brit living in LA , Lemmy used to play in the space-rock band Hawkwind and formed Motorhead when he was kicked out _ as he was from every other group he 'd ever been in .
`` We 're heavy and , sometimes , we 're not heavy , '' Durst says .
The Ozzfest is a proving ground but not , Durst hopes , a competition .
`` Our world today is really emotional , '' says Durst .
In a delightfully honest essay in GQ -LRB- $ 3 -RRB- , titled `` The Snow Job of Kilimanjaro , '' Lorian Hemingway , author of the memoir `` Walk on Water , '' criticizes the commercialization of the family name and bemoans the publication of work her grandfather did not consider ready for print .
Singer-choreographer Fred Durst wants a multimedia empire _ and some respect .
Inside Iran : Much has changed in Iran since a group of Americans were held hostage at the U.S . Embassy in Tehran .
But Durst is not the loser he would like people to think he is .
Durst 's social conservatism was just like that of a talk-radio host : he played the schlumpy , marginalized Everyman who just wants a chance to live without interference from a bunch of weirdos .
This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos , and if Durst had any talent as a singer .
His limited range was clearly exposed when Aaron Lewis of Staind , the night 's opening group , outsang him during the ballad `` No Sex. ''
Durst 's rapping engages when it gains a flippant tone , but he seems to prefer desolate moaning .
Most irritating , though , is Durst 's outsider stance , through which the band gains emotional credibility .
But to feel connected with Durst , his fans must relate to his estrangement .
The rap group reprised its groundbreaking 1986 rap-metal remake of Aerosmith 's `` Walk This Way '' before Kid Rock emerged from the wings in a white fur coat , hat and vinyl pants , an inner-city vision of fashion overkill .
Meanwhile , a former white rapper , Everlast of the group House of Pain -LRB- `` Jump Around '' -RRB- , has crossed over to the modern rock charts with his socially conscious `` Whitey Ford Sings the Blues , '' a cycle of cautionary tales that translate as hip-hop for the coffeehouse crowd .
More comically , there are the Detroit acts Eminem -LRB- `` My Name Is ... '' -RRB-
Chuck D , whose seminal rap group Public Enemy has exerted a strong influence over rock acts since the late 1980s , is n't as impressed .
But when bands as self-consciously square as Canada 's jokey Barenaked Ladies can kick their record sales into overdrive by rapping , as the group does on its 1998 hit `` One Week , '' it 's clear pop culture has turned another corner .
`` So , there was and is a hip-hop community that is composed of Jews , blacks , Arabs , Latinos _ you name it .
Durst , who grew up poor in Gastonia , N.C . , tells stories of how his white friends ostracized him in high school because of his affection for rap music .
Real name : Bob Ritchie , 27 .
Got his name as a teenager , while DJ-ing in Detroit 's black housing projects : `` Yo , watch that white kid rock ! ''
Real name : Marshall Mathers , 24 .
Real name : Eric Schrody , 29 .
Everlast is the name of an athletic gear manufacturer best known for its boxing trunks .
M.O . : Made a name with House of Pain , an Irish - American hip-hop act influenced by Cypress Hill .
Lead vocalist : Fred Durst , 28 .
M.O . : One-time tattoo artist and hip-hop fan Durst was befriended by California metal act Korn , which helped the group get signed and put it on its `` Family Values '' tour .
The new release , the group 's second , is sharply produced with radio-friendly fare to help the band expand from its hard-core audience built up through constant touring .
What 's unusual : Durst is a devout Lutheran .
Performing `` Walk This Way , '' which in the 13-year-old version first united rockers with a hip-hop group , these musicians represented what pop might have become in the 1980s , had not a decade of music industry segregation ensued .
His group worked through the refreshing subtleties of `` The Fragile , '' the title track of the band 's new album .
Wit shone in the cutting repartee of Rock , who spared no one except a few reigning legends like the Artist and Madonna , and the performance of the mysterious Torrance Community Dance Group .
The group bumbled its way through a live routine that poked sweet fun at the cliches of awards-ceremony choreography , making sure this event came equipped with its own parody .
It was Durst who put his finger on the scale .
Fred Durst appeared in `` Backstage Sluts 2 . '' Porn gives bands cool points and boosts their fan base .
And at that point , rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem kids .
These days , Fred Durst , the man who has taken lumps for `` triggering '' Woodstock , hedges his bets , sounding simultaneously apologetic and defiant .
`` I literally do n't do anything to hurt anyone , '' Durst says .
Durst , 29 , grew up in Gastonia , N.C . , a small town where one of his best friends was a black kid whose father , a D.J . , played Fred rap records that he had bought in New York .
`` All of a sudden I was obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling , '' Durst explains .
In a place like Gastonia , and then Jacksonville , Fla . , where his family moved , Durst was called `` nigger lover . ''
In the years after school , Durst fathered a child , spent a year in the Navy , worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band .
Durst sits on a couch , repairing a skateboard as the rest of the group sets up .
Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope Records ; as a high-ranking talent scout , he envisions huge battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country , with the best getting signed to his label .
And Durst says he has raised `` hundreds of thousands of dollars '' for a cable channel featuring round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming .
The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst 's sloping shoulders .

The target is Napster , the software company that allows computer users to swap music files with other users for free , whether the music is by unknown bands or superstars .
Either way , the artists do n't get royalties _ and this issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians , record labels , and increasingly , the courts , which have been asked to rule on copyright questions regarding online piracy .
Metallica 's response was to hire a British firm , NetPD , to monitor three days of Napster activity earlier this week , which turned up 333,082 screen names of users who traded 1.4 million Metallica songs _ an average of nearly five songs per person _ during that time , said Gayle Fine of the band 's management company , Q Prime .
But the RIAA is concerned with signed artists who record for labels that do not want to give away their music for free. ''
You 're messing with the record companies now and they do n't want to lose that money , '' adds J.C . Chasez of the band 'N Sync .
The record labels have remained quiet and are letting the RIAA fight its battles , though more and more artists are speaking out .
Once I record something , it 's not public domain to give it away freely .
Napster was founded last year by Shawn Fanning , a 19-year-old then- Northeastern University student who dropped out after his freshman year to move to San Mateo , Calif . , where the company is based .
The firm refers to itself as the `` embattled MP3 file-swapping software company . ''
Many observers say that the major record labels have been slow in climbing aboard the digital revolution , hence the fill-the-breach mentality of services like Napster and my.mp3 . com .
Meanwhile , a new company , myplay . com , has been working with labels on a `` totally legal basis , '' says founder David Pakman , who worked with Apple computer and is also a rock drummer .
His company enables users to have a digital locker of songs , but royalties are paid on them and other listeners can listen to them for two weeks but ca n't copy them .
I believe it 's hurting record sales , but it 's also doing what it 's supposed to do _ building new fans . ''

NANJING , January 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The comet Hale-Bopp , whose cycle of return is 3,000 years , will reach its perigee on April 1 , 1997 , a Chinese scientist said .
When it returns next year its luminosity might surpass that of Haley 's comet when it returned in 1986 , according to astronomers .
The observation and studies of the comet will help in the research into the origins of the earth and its evolution , and provide important background materials which can be used for preventing comets and asteroids from colliding with the earth , Wang said .
SHANGHAI , March 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Hale-Bopp , a newly-discovered extraordinarily large comet in the solar system , has been recently observed for the first time in China .
Astronomers at the Shanghai Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences located the comet , which has a very dim light , 700 million km from the earth .
Drawing closer to the sun at a speed of 1.3 million km per day , the comet is expected to reach the proximity of the sun around the end of March or in early April 1997 .
It was later designated as a new comet by the International Astronomical Union .
It is reported that the comet is 100-150 km in diameter , five to 10 times the size of the world-famed Halley 's Comet .
Major observatories in China are preparing for a co-observation on the comet .
NANJING , April 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Hale-Bopp comet is set to become one of the brightest comets of the 20th century , Chinese astronomers have predicted .
Hale-Bopp was 1.07 billion km away from the sun in last July when it was discovered by two amateur astronomers in the United States .
At that time , the Hale-Bopp was 250 times brighter than the Haley 's comet if the latter were put in the same distance .
The Yunnan Observatory and the Shanghai Observatory had shot pictures of Hale-Bopp comet in February this year .
The comet 's nucleus is 40 km in diameter , and its 'hair ' indicates intensive activities inside .
In August , September and October last year , French astronomers discovered three dust explosions around the comet , each explosion lasted for two days , and the comet was three stellar magnitudes brighter compared to before .
Scientists in the world also found out that the comet spewed out 1,000 kg of carbon monoxide per second when it was 900 million km from the sun , which is equal to the spewing amount of the Haley 's comet when it was 130 million km from the sun .
By that time , people will be able to see the comet with their naked eyes .
Observation of the comet is of great significance for scientific research , Chen Daohan said .
NANJING , December 17 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Chinese scientists in east China 's Jiangsu Province have shot pictures of Hale-Bopp , the newly-discovered comet .
Astronomers at the Purple Mountain Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently succeeded in photographing the comet by using a refracting telescope together with a CCD detector .
The comet has since attracted great attention from astronomers around the world .
Since early this month the comet has appeared in the western part of the sky after sunset , making it difficult for scientists to conduct observatory work .
Astronomers say the best opportunity for observation will start from early February to the middle of March 1997 when the comet can be seen in the eastern sky .
</A>
<A 3.2 >
The orbit of Hale-Bopp is almost vertical to that of the earth , so that scientists will be able to catch some primitive information on the verges of the solar system .
He said that between March 25 to April 10 , the comet moves to the nearest point from the earth and the brightness of the comet will reach its maximum level .

In 1955 , the studio asked him to become a technical adviser on Elia Kazan 's `` East of Eden , '' starring James Dean .
A South Korean court on Wednesday rebuffed an attempt by a relative of James Dean to collect damages from a local company that produces a line of underwear bearing the late actor 's name .
A cousin of Dean , Marcus Winslow Jr . of Jonesboro , Ind . , filed suit in South Korea in 1994 , claiming he represented Dean 's family and estate and had commercial and other rights to the name and image of the icon of American cinema .
Winslow accused J . Enterprise Ltd . and its owner , Joo Byoung-jin , of violating trademark laws by producing `` James Dean '' underwear and opening more than 100 stores to market them .
On Wednesday , Judge Kim Duk -jin of the Seoul Appellate Court said that the plaintiff lacked evidence that he represented Dean 's estate .
Joo said he had registered James Dean 's name as a legitimate trademark with the Korean Industrial Property Office , and refused to pay royalties for using the name .
Winslow had demanded that all of Joo 's James Dean trademarks be invalidated .
J . Enterprise began selling women 's and men 's James Dean underwear in 1990 .
In 1962 , black student James Meredith succeeded on his fourth try to register for classes at the University of Mississippi .
But his big break did n't come until 1988 , when Queen Elizabeth II , an avid horsewoman and racehorse owner , invited him to Windsor Castle after she read about Roberts 's techniques in The Blood Horse , a horse-racing magazine .
But he did more than speak .
He did what he does best _ he did n't whisper , he listened .
Roberts and Dean became friendly , and the young actor asked Roberts to look for a horse farm he might buy .
Those who did n't cooperate were ostracized .
I could tell she did n't want to go , but a deal was a deal .
Where did the children learn about such violence ?
Cary Grant , James Stewart , Spencer Tracy and Gary Cooper all had more substantial starring careers than Humphrey Bogart ; yet Bogie , who died 42 years ago , is a bigger star today than he was during his lifetime , definitely an icon for younger generations .
March did n't make the list , nor did Irene Dunne or Norma Shearer or Jean Arthur or Olivia de Havilland , all of whom had measures of artistic achievement that surpassed Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor , who are legends indeed and expectedly high on the list .
A sure way to become a legend is to die young .
Jean Harlow died 62 years ago at age 26 ; Carole Lombard was 33 when killed in a plane crash 57 years ago ; and James Dean , after three starring roles , was only 24 when he died in a car crash 44 years ago .
Montgomery Clift was n't ; but if the auto accident that almost killed him at age 34 had done so , he would today be a legend equal to or even surpassing Dean .
Bette Davis was the pre-eminent female star during the long heyday of the studios and would be a less sullied legend today if she had simply quit on top , as Garbo and Shearer did .
WEST PALM BEACH , Fla . _ `` There is not a man here who does not feel 400 percent bigger in 1900 than he did in 1896 , bigger intellectually , bigger hopefully , bigger patriotically , bigger in the breast from the fact that he is a citizen of a country that has become a world power for peace , for civilization and for the expansion of its industries and the products of its labor , '' proclaimed Sen . Chauncey Depew of New York as the century turned on its hinge , nearly 100 years ago .
`` But at the same time he has never been tested by a war , he did n't grow up hunting or fishing or farming .
In this period , however , the real heroes are anonymous , generalized types _ Bill Mauldin 's Willy and Joe , Ernie Pyle 's quiet battlefield heroes , the six unidentified Marines atop Iwo Jima 's Mount Suribachi , raising the flag _ men who fight and die in an immense , soundless , black-and-white distance , who never boast and who do not even want to talk about what they 've seen after they make it back home .
Elvis Presley -LRB- 1935-1977 -RRB- , James Dean -LRB- 1931-1955 -RRB- and Marlon Brando -LRB- 1924- -RRB- are the new men : young , surly , cocksure .
But while other icons of the era , like Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe , have been grist for a steady stream of novels , biographies and movies , Dean has , surprisingly , been somewhat ignored , especially in films .
For years filmmakers have toyed with projects about James Dean but were locked in a Catch- 22 : studios would only finance the movie with a star , or at least a name actor .
The playwright Israel Horovitz , who had worked on a James Dean screenplay for years , recalled that the actor Ethan Hawke had told him : `` If you do a James Dean imitation , they 'll kill you .
If you do n't do a James Dean imitation , they 'll kill you .
The film , `` James Dean : An Invented Life , '' is now in production in Los Angeles .
`` His legend has not been treated with appropriate respect , '' said Mark Rydell , 70 , the film 's director , whose credits include `` The Rose '' and `` On Golden Pond '' and who was a friend of Dean 's in New York .
To play Dean , Rydell and Bill Gerber , the movie 's executive producer , selected James Franco , a little-known , 22-year-old television actor from Palo Alto , Calif .
Rydell said he had cast Franco almost as soon as he saw the actor , who bears a resemblance to Dean , and spoke to him at length .
Franco , who has appeared in some television films and independent features as well as the NBC series `` Freaks and Geeks , '' said that during his teen-age years he was often told that he looked like Dean .
`` I do n't have blond hair and blue eyes , like he did , '' said Franco .
`` I took up smoking , like Dean , and cut off most of my friends , '' he said .
Dean 's life was tormented .
Horovitz and Rydell said that Dean 's three films , `` Rebel Without a Cause , '' `` East of Eden '' and `` Giant , '' were stamped by his playing characters who were , like him , anguished , angry and lonely .
Horovitz said the screenplay was , largely , a story about Dean 's hunt for a father who abandoned him when he was 8 his mother died .
`` Dean 's father was a dental technician who worked at a VA hospital in Santa Monica , '' said Horovitz , `` and when the boy 's mother died of cancer , the father shipped the body back on a train to Fairmount , Ind . , with the boy to live with his aunt and uncle .
Years later Dean turned to directors like Elia Kazan , George Stevens and Nicholas Ray and even executives like Jack Warner as father figures .
Just before his death Dean signed what was then an unprecedented $ 1-million deal with Warner for nine films .
Certainly Dean 's personality and the characters he played on screen seemed to foreshadow some of the mood of the 1960s and '70s .
Referring to `` Rebel Without a Cause , '' he declared , `` The film _ and Dean _ demonstrated that adolescents are loaded with anxiety and torture and rage. ''
The Dean screenplay had been circulating at Warner Brothers for nearly a decade under the aegis of Marvin Worth , producer of `` Lenny '' -LRB- 1974 -RRB- and `` The Rose '' -LRB- 1979 -RRB- .
Rydell said he was friendly with Dean in the '50s when they were struggling theater and television actors .

To quote : `` In many respects , we stand in direct opposition to the points of view espoused by the American Association of Retired Persons .
Despite the name , retirement is n't a criteria : Chances are you will -LRB- or did -RRB- receive overtures from AARP around age 50 ; or call 800-424-3410 .
It read : `` Dear friend , forget everything you 've heard about AARP being just for retired people .
But to him and three out of four other baby boomers who have turned 50 since Jan . 1 , 1996 , AARP might as well mean RIP .
Though almost half of all Americans over 50 belong to AARP , only one-quarter of eligible baby boomers do , 50 being the age of eligibility .
`` I 've listened to people say that AARP is rocking chairs and old retired people , '' said Carola Wilson of AARP .
But changing its name to AARP instead of something that embraces boomers and still appeals to existing members might go down as one of the biggest marketing bungles ever , some experts say .
`` Their solution to the problem made it worse , '' says marketing expert James R . Rosenfield , a member of AARP .
Besides , he continued , `` AARP is the world 's worst acronym _ it sounds like a dog barking , like aarp , aarp ! ''
For AARP , there 's a lot at stake .
One , the National Association of Baby Boomers , or NABB , touts itself as the antithesis of AARP .
But Wilson of AARP insists its organization is relevant to boomers and many others over 50 .
For instance , one AARP mailing reads : `` Experience tells us this may not be the most welcome piece of mail you ever received .
Rivkin says AARP chose the same dubious route that Kentucky Fried Chicken did when it rechristened itself KFC to get away from the fear-of-fat word , fried .
`` But in our language all of us grow up understanding that initials stand for something , so we begin translating backwards. ''
And while Tom Otwell of AARP insists people refer to the organization by its individual initials , Rivkin doubts that assertion .
A . R . P . has four syllables , AARP one , '' Rivkin said .
Meanwhile , Scott Aylward , president of advertising agency Barkley Evergreen & Partners in Kansas City , is n't surprised by boomers ' aversion to AARP .
AARP officials declared that it shattered many of the stereotypes of aging and sexuality .
AARP officials released their poll today with a clear appeal to the aging baby boomers , unveiling the latest issue of Modern Maturity , which features a photograph of 52-year-old Susan Sarandon under this headline : `` Great Sex .
An AARP survey released last week found about one in nine grandparents over the age of 50 helps care for at least one grandchild .
</A>
<A 5.2 >
And it 's also one obviously meant to counter the common charge that AARP is the `` selfish seniors '' organization .
`` It 's a hard organization to run , because we 're not focused on just one thing _ we 're not like the National Rifle Association . ''
A nonprofit social welfare organization with the aim of `` enhancing the quality of life for individuals as they grow older , '' AARP offers its members _ who pay annual dues of $ 8 _ a range of benefits and services , including discounts on hotel accommodations , prescription medicines , and insurance .
Because of its vigorous support of the Social Security system and other social programs _ support that it backs up by lobbying Congress and state legislatures , and with grassroots mobilization of members _ critics of AARP claim that it 's more a partisan political pressure group than a nonpartisan social welfare organization .
The American Association of Retired Persons recently became nothing more than its acronym as the organization realized that almost half of its membership was not retired and a good percentage was n't American .
The struggle to the top of the hill for the organization is storied , somewhat sordid history .
Andrus soon found Palm Beach insurance magnate Leonard Davis , who offered $ 50,000 in seed money that established Colonial Penn Insurance Co . Millions signed up for the insurance with the endorsement of the American Association of Retired Persons , and the non-profit organization reaped benefits in the form of a royalty that was then poured back into programs for the elderly .
But in 1978 , a `` 60 Minutes '' television report painted AARP as a front for the insurance corporation and an outraged membership subsequently dropped Colonial Penn for Prudential Insurance Co . More recently , the organization has aligned itself with United Health Care Corp .
Seniors are still drawn to insurance packages and discounts on cruises and hotels but the organization acknowledges such `` member services '' are no longer enough .
`` There is a misconception that this is a seniors organization , '' said attendee Theresa Contino .
The organization not only wants to be younger , but also more diverse .

If the Rhodes image is simply one of academic excellence achieved by burrowing through a rigorous tunnel of narrow academic pursuits , then you would n't picture Beth Shapiro .
This year 's 32 Rhodes Scholars were chosen from 909 applicants .
When she arrived on the UGA campus in 1994 , she was n't thinking of the Rhodes .
`` We are extremely pleased and excited that with Beth 's selection , UGA has produced Rhodes Scholars three out of the last four years , '' said UGA President Michael Adams .
He joined Time magazine after his years as a Rhodes Scholar and never worked anywhere else until he entered the government .
It records how he was offered athletic scholarships from 75 colleges , chose Duke , but switched at the last minute to Princeton -LRB- which gave him no money -RRB- because it had a better record of producing Rhodes scholars .
It recalls how he would score a record-shattering 45 points on a Saturday night for the Tigers , go straight from the game to the library , and study until it was time to teach his regular Sunday school class .
Richard Lapchick , director of Northeastern University 's Center for the Study of Sport in Society , said part of the mystique of Bradley and the veterans backing him is they stood for old-fashioned values of hard work , selflessness , and discipline that are increasingly hard to identify in many of today 's highly paid and sometimes badly behaved professional athletes .
A British colonialist in the late 19th century , Rhodes ran a mining conglomerate that for decades controlled much of southern Africa .
`` He was talking about taking a Rhodes scholarship from a racist diamond miner . ''
I thought that to be awarded a Rhodes scholarship , as Gore was , a person had to have stellar academic credentials .
Gore was never a Rhodes scholar .
President Clinton , of course , also was a Rhodes scholar .

Seale , joining Hilliard at the microphone for the bus tour , remembers hatching the party 's founding manifesto , the Ten Point Program , late one night .
But Hilliard has at least one political veteran on his side with Seale , who ran for Oakland mayor in 1973 and has worked for former Panther Bobby Rush , a congressman running for Chicago mayor this year .
That , Seale told reporters , was not about murder and drugs , but `` was always all about power to all the people , whether they 're black , white , yellow or polka-dot. ''
As a young man , David Hilliard plunged into the raw , radical politics of the Black Panthers .
Oakland , a city of 396,000 with Jerry Brown as mayor , is 43 percent black , 28 percent white , 14 percent Hispanic and 14 percent Asian .
Hilliard , 56 , said his campaign may be based on Black Panther ideals but is n't limited to blacks .
He now works with the foundation and teaches the history of the Black Panthers at the New College in San Francisco .
Hilliard said he wo n't be endorsing all the Black Panther credo , including the practice of carrying firearms , which he said was particular to the civil unrest of the past .
When America grew up , so did the Panthers . ''
Thirty years ago , David Hilliard walked the streets of West Oakland with a black leather jacket on his back and an M-1 carbine in his hands .
These days , the former Black Panther chief of staff makes the trip as a candidate for City Council -- no gun in his grip , less hair on his head , but the same rallying cry :
But Hilliard says the old Black Panther goals of better housing and schools are still relevant .
Stop No . 12 on the Black Panther Legacy Tour is the street corner where Bobby Hutton was fatally shot by police in April 1968 after a protracted gun battle .
Stop No . 11 is the church where the Black Panthers began serving free breakfasts to poor children .
Raising his voice above the engine 's rumble , Hilliard says both sites are key to understanding `` probably the most misunderstood organization in the history of the civil rights movement .
The anti-poverty center , now home to the Ebony Lady Salon , overlooks another party landmark , an intersection where the Panthers demanded a signal light to help schoolchildren cross -- and instigated armed traffic patrols to speed up city response .
`` I was not only the chairman of the Black Panther Party -- I was the cook of the Black Panther Party , '' he says .
He confesses with a grin that the Panthers , who paid the rent by selling Mao Tse-Tung 's Little Red Book at a sizable mark-up , sold thousands of copies `` before we actually read the book. ''
But bloodier confrontations took the lives of police and Panthers .
But she later worked with Panthers on `` very moderate kinds of coalition politics. ''
`` When America grew up , so did the Panthers , '' he says .
The Black Panther Party collapsed in the late 1970s , brought down by deaths , defections and infighting .
When he announced for council , Hilliard said the Panthers laid the foundation for a liberal like Brown to win in Oakland and joked , `` Jerry is talking like a Panther these days . '' Brown says it 's too early to endorse anyone for the 2000 City Council election .
He was 57 and is best remembered for his use of the phrase `` black power , '' which in 1967 ignited a white backlash and alarmed an older generation of civil rights leaders , including the Rev .
Ture 's advocacy of Pan-Africanism was the last phase in a political evolution that passed from indifference to the civil rights movement , when he was a high school student , to emergence as an effective nonviolent volunteer risking his life in the battle against segregation , to honorary prime minister of the Black Panther Party .
It was the `` Freedom Summer , '' the year that SNCC -LRB- popularly pronounced `` snick '' -RRB- was sending hundreds of black and white volunteers to the South to teach , set up clinics and register disenfranchised black Southerners .
As a SNCC field organizer in Lowndes County in Alabama , where blacks were in the majority but were politically powerless , he helped raise the number of registered black voters to 2,600 from a mere 70 _ 300 more than the number of whites registered to vote .
Displeased by the response of the established parties to the success of the registration drive , he organized the all-black Lowndes County Freedom Organization , which , to fulfill a state requirement that all parties have a logo , took a black panther as its symbol .
The panther was later adopted by the Black Panther Party .
He once recalled watching from his hotel room in a little Alabama town while nonviolent black demonstrators were beaten and shocked with cattle prods by the police .
Barely a month after his selection , Carmichael , then just 25 , raised the call for black power , thereby signaling a crossroads in the civil rights struggle .
Increasingly uncomfortable with King 's resolute nonviolence , he sensed a shift among some younger blacks in the direction of black separatism .
`` What we are going to start saying now is ` Black Power ! '' '
`` Black Power ! ''
But if Carmichael 's call for `` black power '' galvanized many disenfranchised young blacks , it troubled others , who thought it sounded anti-white , provocative and violent .
After the integrationist , nonviolent speeches and sermons of King and others , few Americans , white or black , were prepared for the uncompromising demands of black militants who rallied to Carmichael 's cry .
Many black leaders of the civil rights movement , though eager to avoid a split in the movement , were clearly upset by the use of the phrase and the separatism it seemed to connote .
In the book `` Black Power , '' which Carmichael wrote in 1967 with Charles Hamilton , now a professor of political science at Columbia University , the authors tried to explain the term .
`` It is a call for black people in this country to unite , '' they wrote , `` to recognize their heritage , to build a sense of community .
It is a call for black people to define their own goals , to lead their own organizations . ''
`` When you talk of black power , you talk of building a movement that will smash everything Western civilization has created , '' he told black audiences .
Instead of young people singing `` We Shall Overcome , '' new images of militant black men and women were being shown on television _ black berets , raised fists , men with guns .
And along with goals of social justice and integration came ideas of black separatism and power harking back to the black nationalism that had been preached in the 1920s by Marcus Garvey .
He moved to Guinea , in West Africa , in 1969 , saying , `` America does not belong to the blacks , '' and calling on all black Americans to follow his example .
In July 1969 , three months after he had moved to Africa , he made public a letter announcing his resignation from the Black Panther Party because of what he called `` its dogmatic party line favoring alliances with white radicals . ''
He maintained that continued progress for black Americans could be made only through `` mass political organization on a Pan - African scale. ''
`` Black power , '' he said , `` can only be realized when there exists a unified socialist Africa . ''
He said in a 1967 interview that he was the only black member of the Morris Park Dukes , a neighborhood gang , and described himself as `` a wild , aggressive boy , boozing it up and getting a kick out of petty theft. ''
There were times , David Hilliard concedes , when the Black Panther Party carried a stigma , conjuring images of violence rather than community empowerment , of black separatism rather than multiculturalism .
The campaign was inspired by the new mayor , Edmund G . Brown Jr . , and his progressive politics , Hilliard said , and represents fulfilling the unfinished agenda of the Black Panther Party .
Standing with supporters in front of a high school that is languishing academically , across the street from a row of houses with burglar bars on the windows , the aging revolutionaries said it was obvious that the poverty and lack of education and jobs in the inner cities that the Panthers had hoped to address still existed .
`` We now have a progressive mayor who sounds more like a Black Panther with every speech he makes .
Four years later , the group was credited with helping to elect the city 's first black mayor , Lionel Wilson .
Several former Black Panthers have also run for office _ and won .
Building a community _ that was always the Black Panthers ' concern. ''
The legacy of the Black Panther Party includes starting a free breakfast program , health clinics and bus service for the elderly .
About 2,000 Panthers were arrested around the country during a five-year period beginning in 1967 .
Some 20 Panthers were killed in shootouts with one another , other revolutionaries , the police or the FBI .
Hilliard himself spent several years in prison in the 1970s on charges stemming from a shootout between Panthers and the police .
The Black Panthers had a self-defense posture .
Hilliard has spent a great deal of energy preserving the more noble aspects of the Panthers ' legacy .
Last year , he began a Black Panther Legacy Tour , where for $ 20 , he gave a 60- to 90-minute lesson on the party on a bus ambling through the humble streets of the city 's west side .
He regularly gives talks about the Panthers in the local schools .
In the spring , he said , he will begin teaching a course on the history of the Panthers at a local college .
`` The Black Panthers ' ideals have just as much relevance today as ever , '' Hilliard said .
1960 : The sit-in movement is launched at Greensboro , N.C . , when black college students insist on service at a local segregated lunch counter .
1964 : Malcolm X leaves the Nation of Islam and forms his own religious organization .

1968 : Eldridge Cleaver , the Black Panther Party 's minister of information , publishes his autobiographical volume , `` Soul on Ice . ''
Shirley Chisholm becomes the first black American woman elected to the U.S . Congress .
Brown-Abram , 30 , the daughter of a Black Panther Party leader , grew up in a communal home and attended a Panther -run grade school where students read Mao Tse-tung 's Little Red Book .
`` A lot of people had this swashbuckling idea of the Panthers , '' she says .
These children of the struggle _ the offspring of black militants , nonviolent activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults .
The protest that paralyzed Seattle this year during a World Trade Organization meeting , the Million Man March on Washington , even freedom struggles abroad _ all owe a debt to the movement .
I was the happiest in my life when I was in the Black Panther Party . ''
He personified black rage .
`` It 's time for us to stop calling white folks the devil , because there 's some black devils , too , '' Mohammed said after taking over .
Elijah Muhammad was n't a racist , he says , but rather an uneducated man who patched together a religion that taught black people self-reliance .
`` He 's told a million black men that they need to atone and take responsibility for their families , but he has n't done either in his personal life. ''
On Sept . 20 , 1962 , Mississippi Gov . Ross Barnett Sr . , a staunch segregationist , blocked the admission of James Meredith , a black man , to the University of Mississippi .
Recently , a black journalist refused to shake Barnett 's hand when he learned who his father was .
Many of his clients are black .
And he was n't a racist , Barnett insists : He had black friends and even left money in his will for two African-Americans , a quail-hunting companion and a masseur .
CHILD OF THE PANTHERS : Ericka Brown -Abram
Bullets , berets and black leather jackets .
Throughout Ericka Brown-Abram 's early life , whether she was attending high school in Beverly Hills , Calif . , or Spelman College in Atlanta , those were the images people focused on when they discovered that her mother was a leader of the Black Panther Party .
The organization was about to implode _ many of its leaders had been wounded or killed , and it was riddled with FBI informers .
Students wore black berets and called playmates `` comrades , '' but they were forbidden to play with toy guns .
She says she is often struck by modern-day reminders that the Black Panthers ' agenda remains relevant .
His funeral drew thousands of people , white and black .

If Woodstock '99 proved anything musically , it was how eagerly young fans have embraced the marriage between rap and hard rock .
The company produces gritty rap music through its records unit , he notes , and distributes violent movies like `` Pulp Fiction '' even as it makes `` 101 Dalmatians . ''
In this nation , the boundaries are more fluid and blurry than many people would like to believe : white people are listening to and using elements of rap not for theft but because they relate to it , because the music is a legitimate part of their cultural heritage .
Black and white music fans are driving around flipping back and forth between the local rock and rap radio stations , simply looking for the best song .
And in this nation black rappers are finding that it is now possible to serve both the black and the white audience without betraying either ; they are finding that any adolescent who has ever felt victimized can relate to most rap lyrics because pop music has always communicated through metaphor , innuendo and fantasy ; and they are finding that certain common denominators transcend race , as in the Jay-Z and DMX song `` Money , Cash , Hoes . ''
In 1999 , not only is the most important and popular white music being made derived from rap , but hip-hop is easily the most important genre in America .
In the suburbs , rap has been integral to youth life style since at least 1986 , when for the first time a rap album -LRB- by the Beastie Boys -RRB- crossed over to No . 1 on the Billboard charts .
So , understandably , there is a lot of hand-wringing going on in the rap community , because the music 's mission to spread across the land has succeeded all too well .
What most white performers are doing with rap is hijacking it , using it to breathe new life into their music , not unlike what the Beatles and the Rolling Stones did with the blues -LRB- or what Jamaicans like Coxsone Dodd and the Skatalites did with American R-and-B -RRB- .
Because there is rap music that speaks to all these people .
And rap music has been the biggest it 's ever been .
Sony Music Entertainment plans to make more than 4,000 albums from its catalogs available on demand by storing them on computers and sending them directly to stores via a high-speed computer network .
Customers would be able to receive the music in a variety of formats , including CD , DVD , and MiniDisc , or have it installed directly onto a digital music player .
Artwork and liner notes for the music printed out on a laser printer will also be available for purchase .
While the fast and easy digital access may be music to the ears of consumers , some industry analysts cautioned that Sony must overcome a few obstacles .
Forrester Research analyst Mark Hardie said the diminished laser printer quality of photos and art that accompany the music may work against an increasingly visual consumer .
Ice T shocked many music fans in the early 1990s when he started a parallel career with the hard rock band Body Count .
For followers of music history , these new acts follow a familiar pattern of white artists succeeding with a style invented in black communities .
When DMX _ who , more than most popular rappers before him , orients his music toward a strictly black audience _ came on stage , the almost entirely white crowd pumped its collective fist in the air and sang along with every word , drowning out DMX himself as they shouted the lyrics to `` My Niggas . ''
It dominates popular music .
It is a birthright , something white kids grow up listening to , a standard by which they calibrate their lifetime notion of pop music .
And as they grow older , the music they want to make and hear is music that incorporates both genres -LRB- just as Kid Rock says today that he was weaned on both Lynyrd Skynyrd and Big Daddy Kane -RRB- .
White kids are also intrinsically attracted to hip-hop because it is the only popular music genre that their rockist baby-boomer parents just do n't get .
But the more street and coded hip-hop becomes -LRB- as in the music of Juvenile , DMX , JT Money or Trick Daddy -RRB- , the more attractive it is to a middle-class white audience .
In the meantime , scores of white bands are incorporating hip-hop DJs while just as many are rapping , but most without paying more than lip service to the culture the music came from .
But rest assured , as hip-hop leaves its original context , it transmutes -LRB- just as gospel became rhythm-and-blues in a secular environment and rhythm-and-blues became rock ` n ' roll when Alan Freed did n't want it to seem as if his 1950s white radio audience was listening to black music -RRB- .
`` I do n't think it 's a put-down to say that a white kid ca n't sing a black man 's music , '' the former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman said in a recent interview in The Oxford American .
`` If you really love the music , you can get pretty close and you can do it your way _ you do n't do it their way .
Is it Seagrams , Time Warner and Thorn-EMI , the multinational conglomerates that distribute most of the music ?
He 's screening an early episode of `` Farmclub . com , '' a weekly music show he 's producing on the USA network .
It 's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections between outrageous music and outrageous behavior , if only because his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of the line .
Iovine 's artists have been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior , so he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the Michigan killing .
I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal 's ground zero , home to Kid Rock , Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who needed Kid Rock in their lives , an artist raising the self-esteem of doormats everywhere .
Still , the music itself can sometimes be profound .
White music fans have long been curious about black culture , but the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new .
wishing I were a Negro , feeling that the best the white world offered was not enough ecstasy for me , not enough life , joy , kicks , darkness , music , not enough night. ''
Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always been a part of rock 'n ' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away , but today 's full-out family trauma is different , and part of what makes rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop music , teen bubble gum .
Not everyone is happy with where the music is going .
The African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit -LRB- along with Elvis and Kenny G -RRB- on his recent album `` Black on Both Sides , '' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n ' roll are both black music that whites have appropriated .
And Durst says he has raised `` hundreds of thousands of dollars '' for a cable channel featuring round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming .

Folded the wrong way , prions induce other proteins to mimic them .
Dr . Stephen DeArmond , a pathologist at the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco , explained that the normal prion protein was folded in a loopy pattern resembling corkscrews .
Generally , they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on paper but carry large consequences .
When their molecules are folded into the correct shape , prions are benign , though no one knows their function .
The misfolded prions then accumulate in parts of the brain , causing the tissue to break down and become full of holes , like a sponge .
In a case outlined in Thursday 's New England Journal of Medicine , a 44-year-old patient had all the symptoms of the inherited disease , including prions with the same `` signature , '' but did not have the inherited mutation .
Prions are still controversial .
However , the new studies add to evidence the infection is caused by the abnormal shape of the prions , not another agent , Drs .
Officials of Roslin Bio-Med Ltd . in Scotland , where the lamb clone Dolly was produced , made the announcement along with officials of Kimeragen Inc . , a Newtown , Pa . , firm that developed the method for rewriting DNA sequences in genes .
The method is called `` chimeraplasty '' or `` precise genetic surgery '' and relies on high-quality molecules called `` chimeraplasts '' that are made by Boston Biosystems of Bedford .
Prions can mutate to cause and transmit mad-cow disease and its variants in other animals .
But for reasons that are not at all understood , normal prions sometimes transform themselves into tiny particles that can not be killed with boiling water , chemical disinfectants or strong radiation .
These prions , almost impossible to destroy , accumulate in the brains of infected animals and people , destroying cells and leaving spongy holes in the tissue .
But a new variant of CJD now is killing young Britons who acquired the disease from eating cattle infected with abnormal prions of their own .
Unlike the misfolded prions in sporadic CJD , which are found exclusively in brain tissue , new variant prions are found in the brain , tonsils , appendix , spleen and lymph nodes .
Pathologists are examining 18,000 specimens from tonsil removed in the last two decades ; 3,000 tonsils have been tested but the results have not been made public , Will said .
Results of experiments , to be published soon , show that the misfolded deer prion can , in a test tube , convert normal human , sheep and cattle prions into deadly prions .
Many said that local pathologists , fearing prions , would not carry out brain biopsies and that some morticians had refused to embalm the bodies of CJD victims .

Right now , the test for finding the proteins , or prions , requires too much labor for large-scale use on cattle , said researcher Dr . Fred Cohen .
It gives an answer in eight hours , vs . the months needed for the standard means of detecting low levels of prions in tissue , Cohen said .
The test involves treating a tissue sample with substances that unfold the prions .
That exposes a section that proteins called antibodies can grab onto , allowing the prions to be detected .
They discovered how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule for the body 's blood vessels , a breakthrough with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence .
The researchers discovered that nitric oxide tells blood vessels to relax and widen , an effect that helps control blood pressure .
At first , scientists did n't think nitric oxide had so many effects , he said , but `` a lot of researchers have now discovered that nitric oxide does so many things and is so important. ''
The prize citation said Murad , while at the University of Virginia in 1977 , discovered that nitroglycerin and other vessel -dilating compounds release nitric oxide .
Researchers , writing in the October issue of the journal Nature Medicine , describe a relatively simple way to detect prions .
Prions are the mutated proteins responsible for the outbreak of the disease in the United Kingdom that led to panic and a ban on exports of British beef .
Prions also are believed to cause a human illness , Cruetzfeldt -Jakob disease , in which holes like those in sponges appear in the brain , leading to dementia and death .
Prions can be infectious , but scientists believe they also can arise spontaneously and from genetic mutations .
Until now , testing for prions meant taking samples from suspected victims , transplanting the material into the brains of lab animals and waiting to see if they develop the disease _ a process that takes two to six months .
The scientists also say they have further proof that there are at least eight different strains of prions , all with the same chemical structure but slightly different folding patterns .

SEATTLE _ Five years after his death , Kurt Cobain is being hailed as the most important rock musician of the '90s .
Grunge dominated rock after 1991 , led by such multiplatinum releases as Nirvana 's `` Nevermind `` and Soundgarden 's `` Badmotorfinger . ''
Dave Grohl , lead singer of the American rock band the Foo Fighters , lost his driving privileges in Australia for three months for riding a moped while drunk .
Love already fronted her own band , Hole -LRB- which released an acclaimed album `` Live Through This , '' days after Cobain 's death -RRB- , but marrying the Nirvana frontman instantly made her more than just another guitar-slinging musician waiting for her big break .
That 's almost all that 's heard of Cobain 's music since Love would n't allow any Nirvana music in the film .
Broomfield 's sources are hardly the most reliable people , and there are no conversations with those who spent a great deal of time with Cobain , including his former Nirvana bandmates Dave Grohl , now of Foo Fighters , and Krist Novoselic .
Credited with reviving rock at a time when it had become tame and predictable , Nirvana 's lead singer and guitarist galvanized a generation of listeners with his raw , abrasive songs and soul-searing lyrics .
`` Nevermind , '' Nirvana 's breakthrough 1991 album , last month reached an important milestone , climbing to 10 million in certified U.S . sales .
I think that 's exactly what 's going to happen with Nirvana .
While the fifth anniversary of Cobain 's death is n't being commemorated publicly , KNDD is planning a full day of programming devoted to Nirvana , which included drummer Dave Grohl , now with the Foo Fighters , on Thursday .
To wit : The success of a performer such as Marilyn Manson , who capitalizes on the same themes , substituting theatrical shock tactics and professional cynicism for Nirvana 's earnest angst .
`` Every time I start to believe , something 's raped and taken from me , '' rails lead vocalist Jon Davis on the new single `` Freak on a Leash . ''
Specifically , they 've sold millions of copies of their first two CDs , `` Sixteen Stone '' and `` Razorblade Suitcase , '' if only because they came along with the perfect sound at the perfect time : They mimicked Nirvana as Nirvana was leaving us .

This is one of the promises of Muzak , the ubiquitous music heard in Crate & Barrel and Citibank , in malls and McDonald 's .
Here it calms and there it soothes , not to mention the Muzak company 's sales pitch : that properly chosen background music can boost sales and increase productivity .
Something of a protogeek , General Squier experimented with ways to deliver music directly into homes via electrical lines .
To counter that , stimulating music _ chosen for its variations in tempo and instrumentation _ is piped in through office intercoms .
`` Background music used to play a covert role in a particular environment , '' he said .
`` Now businesses recognize that they can put the power of music to work to create emotional connections .
The elements of foreground music , which makes up the vast majority of Muzak 's catalog , are pop songs in their original form .
Instrumental background music , also known as environmental music , is what people most associate with the company , though it 's only a small portion of Muzak 's services .
After a song is commissioned in its original form or transformed into environmental music , it is evaluated by an audio architect .
The architect rates the song in 45 detailed categories : the mood of the music ; its instrumentation ; its color -LRB- dark or light -RRB- , and whether it is by a male or female vocalist .
Fulfilling the vision of General Squier 's Wired Radio , the music is then sent by modem from the Seattle headquarters to satellite uplink stations in Cheyenne , Wyo . , and Raleigh , N.C . Subscribers receive the transmissions via 18-inch dishes on their roofs .
Aside from smaller background music companies in local markets , Muzak dominates the industry .
While some businesses choose to use for background music something like , say , an easy listening station , Muzak says that the frequent commercial breaks are a downside to such practices .
According to Muzak 's Lauren Hower , the problem for the company is when offices or retail stores prefer to work without any music at all .
Elevator music , he said , `` is just an urban myth. ''
`` My mom was a music teacher and had been making me play piano since I was like 5 years old .
I want to learn how to play drums . '
`` I never learned to play like Keith Moon , '' he added , laughing .
With Garbage , which will perform a sold-out show Saturday at the Aerial Theater in Houston , Vig is learning yet another way to play the drums .
`` I play acoustic drums , but it triggers samples that we used on the records .
`` But we love using technology to bring all these different elements into the music .
`` When we 'd do a remix , we 'd erase all the tracks except the vocals and record new music , '' he said .
Grohl is equal parts facetious and sincere _ devoted to music while at the same time harboring a healthy cynicism about the music industry machinery , and a healthy sense of humor about himself .
`` It seems like they 're about music , not about image or roaring , crazy , dangerous youth dynamics .
But if we were to get out in front of Korn 's audience and play something that sounded like the Eagles , we 'd get our -LRB- butts -RRB- kicked. ''
On the contrary : `` I 'm a little unhappy with popular music these days , and the lack of introspection is my biggest problem .
After about a year of touring the drummer did n't want to play someone else 's drum parts , then Pat -LRB- guitarist Pat Smear -RRB- , who 's never been in a band for very long , said `you guys should be a three -piece ' .

The Morton acquisition comes just more than a month after Rohm and Haas agreed to acquire LeaRonal , a maker of plastic additives and electronic and agricultural chemicals , for $ 460 million .

On Wednesday the Chemical Manufacturers Association will announce that the industry is spending more than $ 1 billion to do just that .
At a luncheon in Washington on Wednesday , the chemical industry plans to spell out the particulars of a six-year research program that will gather data on toxicity and other details of nearly 3,000 so-called high production volume chemicals , common substances like turpentine or acetylene that are produced or imported in quantities of more than 1 million pounds a year .
`` This will let us apply our understanding of how one chemical behaves to predicting how a whole class of chemicals will act , '' said Roger McClellan , president of the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology , the industry-financed research center that first raised an alarm about the link between formaldehyde and nasal cancers .
Philadelphia -based Rohm and Hass will also assume $ 268 million of Morton 's debt as part of the latest deal .
`` The marriage of Morton 's highly respected applications expertise with our technology strengths will provide customers unsurpassed value , '' said J . Lawrence Wilson , chairman and chief executive of Rohm and Haas .
Under terms of the agreement , Rohm and Haas will begin a cash tender offer for up to 67 percent of Morton 's common stock at $ 37.12 a share .
Rohm and Haas will acquire the remaining Morton shares in a `` second -step merger '' in which each share of Morton will be exchanged for Rohm and Haas shares valued at $ 37.12 .
Wilson will remain chairman and chief executive officer of Rohm and Haas and Stewart will become a vice chairman of Rohm and Haas and will join the board of directors .
Two members of Morton 's board will join Stewart on the Rohm and Haas board .
The industry has promised to post all its data on the association 's Web page -LRB- www . cma . org -RRB- as the data come in .
Referring to the industry 's toxicology institute , Olden said , `` The CIIT has always operated fairly and independently and it subjects its research to the most rigorous peer review. ''

What fans will want to know , now that the hype can be replaced with actuality , is whether `` The Phantom Menace '' is sufficiently of a piece with the first three films to make it worth seeing .

Best spoke all of Jar Jar 's lines , invented his reptilian noises and physically acted out the scenes , but he was ultimately replaced with a computer image .
The kids toward whom the new film is frankly skewed will storm the malls and multiplexes to see Ewan McGregor 's Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young hothead Jedi warrior , how Obi-Wan 's wise mentor , Liam Neeson 's Qui-Gon Jinn , teaches him control , and how they both discovered Jake Lloyd 's prodigy , Anakin Skywalker , before he even knew there was such a thing as The Force , much less a Dark Side of it .
We 're also introduced to Natalie Portman 's young queen Amidala , who becomes the mother of Luke and Leia ; to Samuel L . Jackson 's Mace Windu , whose role as a Jedi Council mainstay is so small you know he 'll be back in later episodes ; and to Ahmed Best 's comic relief , Jar Jar Binks , a rubber-limbed amphibian Gumby figure who talks funny and walks clumsy and brightens the rather long and lightweight film a lot .

`` Episode I _ The Phantom Menace '' boasts completely realized alien worlds , 60 new species to inhabit them and dozens of never-before-seen vehicles to travel upon and between them .
The movie 's most impressive setpiece is a 10-minute pod race on the desert planet of Tatooine .
Inspired by the `` Ben Hur '' chariot race sequence , the high-speed contest involves rickety , jet engine-powered `` hot rods '' that zip along a few feet above the rocky surface .
The race 's highly kinetic visuals were overseen by John Knoll , a CG genius who was one of the authors of the popular Photoshop software system .
But the loud , varied , almost living pod race sound showcases Burtt 's wizardry like nothing before .
Two weeks after the hotly awaited American release of `` Episode 1 : The Phantom Menace , '' otherwise die-hard fans of George Lucas 's space opera are beginning to wonder about the wholesomeness of noseless baddies who speak in high-pitched Japanese accents , a filthy bloated insect who sounds either Greek or Arabic , and a computer-generated idiot alien who talks like a Caribbean galley- slave .

In 1998 , Iraq , Libya and the United States were among seven countries that voted against a treaty to create the court .
And yet in July 1998 , when the draft treaty to create the ICC was approved in Rome , the United States found itself in a nasty minority , siding with Libya , Iraq , Yemen and Qatar against the court .
William Pace , head of a coalition of more than 1,000 grass-roots groups backing the court , said Tuesday the proposals would undermine the independence , effectiveness and credibility of the court .
American officials felt the treaty yielded too much prosecutorial power to the new court , leaving U.S . troops and citizens vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions .
This month the United States formally introduced proposals , aimed at insulating Americans from the court 's jurisdiction , to the commission preparing for its operation .
Under the treaty , the court can exercise jurisdiction when either the country where the crime takes place or the country whose nationals commit the crime have ratified the statute .
Bruce Broomhall of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said the U.S . proposal would give countries that do n't sign the treaty power to prevent the court from prosecuting their nationals -- unless the country agrees or the U.N . Security Council approves .
The Rome statute also barred the Security Council from interfering with the court taking a case unless all five permanent council members and the majority of the 15 -member council approved .
Richard Dicker , associate counsel of Human Rights Watch , said the U.S . proposal would undo this compromise by giving any of the five permanent council members -- the United States , Russia , Britain , France or China -- veto over the court taking jurisdiction .
'' It would increase the control of the Security Council and its five permanent members over the court and decrease the court 's independence and hence its legitimacy that is so necessary to credibility and effectiveness , '' he said .
Pace , head of the Coalition for an International Criminal Court , said the United States tried but failed to exempt Americans from prosecution during the treaty negotiations .
That scenario may not seem far-fetched now that the United Nations is in the process of establishing a permanent international criminal court aimed at holding accountable those responsible for actions deemed to be war crimes or crimes against humanity .
While offering millions to track down war crimes suspects in the Balkans , the United States is trying to carve out a blanket exemption protecting American soldiers from being hunted down and prosecuted by the new U.N . court .
'' If an Iraqi military commander committed crimes against humanity against Iraqi citizens , Iraq as a nonparty state could deny the court the authority to prosecute .
Only 10 countries have ratified the proposal ; five dozen are needed to create the court .
Nothing would prevent the court from going after Americans even if the United States is not a member , or '' nonparty state . ''
'' We do not believe our armed forces should be subject to surrender to the court because we are a nonparty to the court , '' Scheffer said .
One proposal the Clinton administration is pushing would prevent the court from pursuing citizens of nonparty states unless the U.N . Security Council authorizes it , or if such states have been condemned by the council '' for whatever reason. ''
Regardless of the outcome in New York , the prospects of the United States becoming a court member are doubtful as long as Sen . Jesse Helms , R - N.C . , is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
'' So long as there is breath in me , the U.S . will never -- I repeat , never -- allow its national security decisions to be judged by an International Criminal Court , '' he said .
Whether the United States can achieve that remains to be seen : Scheffer , the ambassador -at-large for war crimes issues , said his deadline is June 30 , when the commission preparing for the court 's operation ends a three-week meeting .
The European Union rejected the U.S . proposals circulated in March to deal with the exemption issue , and a coalition of more than 1,000 human rights and grass-roots groups has been lobbying delegations not to accept any U.S . changes that would undermine the court 's effectiveness and credibility .
Pressure on the Clinton administration intensified Wednesday when Helms , the North Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , introduced legislation that would bar any U.S . cooperation with the court , as long as the United States has not ratified the treaty creating it .
Nonetheless , it is helping draft the court 's rules of procedure and evidence .
The court was created to deal with the most heinous crimes -- genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Under the treaty , the court will step in only when states are unwilling or unable to dispense justice .
The United States objects that American citizens can be subject to the court 's jurisdiction if an alleged crime is committed in a country that ratified the treaty -- even if the United States is not a party .
Helms ' legislation would require U.S . personnel to be '' immunized '' from the court 's jurisdiction before the United States participated in any U.N . peacekeeping operations .
'' It 's not going to stop the court .
A congressional attempt to prohibit an international court from prosecuting Americans as war criminals is n't helping -- and may make matters worse -- during negotiations on how the court will work , the U.S . war crimes ambassador said Wednesday .
Nonetheless , the United States is helping draft the court 's rules of procedure and evidence .
A bill working its way through Congress '' will worsen our negotiating position '' during negotiations on the court , Ambassador David Scheffer told the House International Relations Committee .
The United States objects that American soldiers and government officials can be subject to the court 's jurisdiction if an alleged crime is committed in a country that ratified the treaty -- even if the United States is not a party .
Under the American Servicemembers ' Protection Act in the House and Senate , American soldiers would not be able to participate in global peacekeeping missions in many countries that participate in the ICC and American officials would not be able to cooperate with the court , Scheffer said .
Such issues must be resolved before the United States moves forward with further participation with the court , Smith said .
The Spanish judge who sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet called Saturday for nations to ratify a treaty creating the world 's first permanent war crimes court and criticized the United States for opposing it .
'' It is important to emphasize that the International Criminal Court will not try countries , but individuals . ''
'' Yet , it is fiercely opposed to the creation of the International Criminal Court . ''
At least , this seemed to be America 's position for the last four years as Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright touted the establishment of the International Criminal Court as a key foreign-policy aim .
Though international meetings on the ICC began in 1994 , the United States failed to decide key issues _ would it back the court ?
True , the evaluation of the court 's ultimate potential -LRB- and whether America should join -RRB- , as well as the court 's future , will hinge on the sound choice of a prosecutor and judges , and the enunciation of prosecutorial priorities .
Yet an historic opportunity to shape the court in America 's image was lost .
What we got instead was a court America can not agree to _ at least not until its good faith has been tested over years .
After triumph at the Ottawa land - mines conference _ where they brushed aside U.S . military needs in Korea _ a caucus of so-called like-minded states , under Canadian and Norwegian leadership , demanded an unfettered court .
Moreover , the European Union had also hailed an independent court as the hallmark of its post- Bosnia try for a unified foreign and security policy .
U.S . negotiators made no objection to the complaint system that allows any state party , friend or foe , to refer investigations to the court without Security Council approval .
Yet Washington vehemently opposed an independent prosecutor out of fear he might start investigations on his own motion , subject only to court approval .
The Rome conference established that for the first seven years , states need only accept the court 's power over genocide and crimes against humanity -LRB- though at the end , countries must accept war-crimes coverage as well or quit the treaty -RRB- .
Indeed , exposure of U.S . troops and commanders to judgment by an international court free to decide for itself what is a `` disproportionate '' use of force -LRB- and hence a war crime -RRB- should concern Washington .
In order to secure defendants , evidence and funding , the new court must rely on the goodwill of many states _ but foremost among them , the world 's one remaining superpower .
Unless it acts scrupulously , the court will never win financial backing .
Many states hope that the United Nations will fund the new court in its first years of operation .
While other states will resist explicit American conditions on tribunal funding -LRB- thanks to the ongoing U.N . dues battle -RRB- , they must recognize that the United States will never bankroll an abusive court .
The U.S . military role in international security will not be altered by the evangelism of an international court .
After all , the court was set up to address the horrors of contemporary civil wars , not cut down America 's preeminence in the post- Cold War world .
UNITED NATIONS _ The United States , isolated among the nations of the world , is going into a crucial conference Monday on the soon-to-be-established International Criminal Court still asking for changes its charter .
The United States is trying to protect American soldiers and officials from falling under the court 's jurisdiction .
But all members of the European Union and other members of NATO support the court and have told the United States that there should be no attempt to reopen debate on how it will work .
The Clinton administration has been unable to win support for the court from the Pentagon and Sen . Jesse Helms , the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
He has declared that the court treaty would be dead on arrival if submitted to his panel .
In Rome , 120 nations voted for the court .
In the last two years , more than 95 nations have signed the statute establishing the court and 12 have ratified it , with 60 ratifications needed for the court to begin functioning .
William Pace , convenor of the Coalition for an International Criminal Court , an umbrella group for more than 1,000 human rights groups and independent legal organizations , called the French action `` a clear signal to the United States that major nations and allies are continuing to progress toward completing the ratification , and they are not willing to reopen the treaty. ''
Exempting citizens of countries who have not ratified the treaty , he added , `` would drastically undermine the effectiveness of the International Criminal Court and would provide an opening not only for the United States to protect its officials and soldiers but also for the so-called rogue countries the court should have as it primary focus .
Richard Dicker , counsel for Human Rights Watch , said that legal experts who support the court are puzzled at the strength of the opposition to the court , since it gives countries whose citizens are charged with international crimes the right to try them in their own courts , as the United States has frequently done through courts martial when American soldiers are involved in criminal activity .
Until Dec . 31 , countries can sign the International Criminal Court treaty and ratify later .
In a recent interview here , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright indicated that there was no chance that the United States would sign this year unless the court statute is changed .
European and other diplomats here say that most nations would like to find a way to include the United States because the court would be considerably weakened and undervalued without American involvement .
Critics of the court object to what they say is the legal authority it would have without an acceptable constitutional base .
John Bolton , a former assistant secretary of state for international organizations in the Bush administration , calls the establishment of the court `` a stealth approach to eroding our constitutionalism '' _ for all branches of American government .
`` This court is going to happen , '' John L . Washburn , co-chairman of the independent Washington Working Group on the International Criminal Court , wrote last month in an Internet column for the Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs in New York .
`` The 1945 Nuremberg tribunal established forever the personal responsibility and accountability of those who are guilty of the worst of crimes .
DHAKA , May 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Bangladeshi Chief Justice Latifur Rahman said here Tuesday that Bangladesh would ratify the Rome Statute to set up an international criminal court -LRB- ICC -RRB- for establishing international rule of law in the global perspective .
`` The International Court will be established after 60 member states of the United Nations ratify the proposal for setting up of a permanent International Criminal Court , '' the chief justice said while inaugurating a national conference on `` International Criminal Court and Ratification by Bangladesh . ''
He said it is `` indeed gratifying '' to note that at last the international community has recognized the importance of setting up of a permanent international criminal court to bring those criminals to justice .

As the MENA economic conference entered its second day today , Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdulla Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah told Xinhua that his country would keep its ties with Israel frozen until progress is made in the Middle East peace process .

As Israel is warming up for resuming peace talks with Syria , Sror said he would not be surprised if being told some day to abandon the kibbutz .
Moreover , Europe 's leaders say they must keep the rural population in touch with an urban society that is rapidly changing through technology and globalization , or there will very likely be greater dislocation in the countryside as young country people find themselves even less prepared for jobs than they are today .
The Gulf country signed a memorandum with a U.S . company on the 2 billion dollar package at the Amman economic summit last year .

There are now 275 kibbutz communities in Israel , scattering throughout the country from the Golan Heights in the north to the Red Sea in the south .
Explaining why kibbutz communities have survived for nine decades , Getz pointed out to their ability to make changes to different conditions and adapt to advanced technologies and management methods .
More and more kibbutz communities are separating economic management system from the social management system , Getz said .
Meanwhile , he stressed that the kibbutz communities that focused on agriculture production have begun to develop industrial projects .
Industry now makes up about 70 percent of the total kibbutz production .
Getz noted that the kibbutz communities are now playing a very important role in Israel 's economy .
He said that the 125,000 kibbutz members constitute only 2.5 percent of Israel 's population , but their contribution to the national economy accounts for 40 percent in agricultural sector , 7.7 percent in industrial output , 8.4 percent in industrial export and 10 percent in tourism .

July 23 , 2000 : British Airways discloses that cracks had been found in the wings of all seven of its Concorde jets .
July 25 , 2000 : An Air France Concorde en route to New York crashes outside Paris shortly after takeoff , killing all 109 people on board and four people on the ground .
French investigators focused Wednesday on the Air France Concorde 's powerful Rolls Royce engines -- one of which was repaired just before Tuesday 's doomed flight -- as the possible cause of the first-ever Concorde crash .
A last-minute repair was made at the request of the pilot , but right after take off Tuesday , the same engine was trailing flames .
The airline 's statement did not indicate whether the repair could have led to the catastrophe .
Even without the repair to the thruster , Flight AF4590 had been cleared for departure Tuesday because it still met a technical level of tolerance allowed by the manufacturer , Air France said .
Since a replacement was not available , workers made the repair using a part from a backup Concorde , the airline said .
The pilot told the tower that he could not stop the flight and was trying to reach Le Bourget , a nearby airport .
Andre Turcat , the pilot who flew the first test flight of the Concorde in 1969 , said Wednesday he believed the cause of the accident was '' much more serious '' than just a malfunctioning engine .
A stall occurs when there is insufficient airspeed over the wings to create the lift that sustains an aircraft 's flight .
Though the Concorde flies higher and faster than passenger jetliners , its four Rolls Royce Olympus engines do not differ greatly from slower and lower-flying models on other commercial jets .
The Concorde is the only commercial jetliner to use afterburners , which provide extra thrust .
At supersonic speeds , air entering the Concorde 's engines is slowed down before it is combined with fuel and combusted for thrust , like in other commercial jetliners .
Concordes take off at subsonic speeds and do not break the speed of sound until they are over the ocean .
Because of their unique design , they take off faster and steeper than other jets -- a fact some aviation experts pointed out after Tuesday 's crash .
'' Concorde is unusual in that the two engines on each wing are very close together .
'' But with Concorde the engines are so close that it is possible one could affect the other and then you have a much more serious situation. ''
Reluctant to trust an engine with a broken part , the pilot of the doomed Air France Concorde delayed his flight for repairs , a terse airline statement said Wednesday .
Terrified witnesses below watched the Concorde 's distinctive needle nose point downward .
Although this fell within the manufacturer 's technical tolerances , the pilot ordered the part replaced before he would take off , the airline 's statement said .
Thrusters , which are used to slow the plane upon landing , were found from a spare Concorde and the repair was made .
A late connecting flight further delayed takeoff from Charles de Gaulle airport , the brief Air France communique said .
'' Only after the spare part was replaced and the luggage loaded did the captain make the decision to depart , '' it concluded .
As flames began to spout from his plane , Marty radioed the tower that his No . 2 engine had failed -- a particularly critical problem in the Concorde , veteran pilots say , because the swept wing aircraft has two engines close together under each wing .
The veteran Concorde captain said he was trying to reach Le Bourget , a smaller and more accessible airport than Charles de Gaulle .
As crash details trickled in slowly , authorities ordered all Air France Concorde flights indefinitely grounded .
France remained in shock at the loss of life in their beloved Concorde .
Two recovered flight recorders were being examined .
But British Airways resumed its London - New York Concorde flights Wednesday after briefly grounding them for safety checks .
And Gayssot said that despite the crash , he still believes the Concorde has a place in the modern world .
'' The Concorde without a doubt died yesterday , '' Le Figaro , a leading Paris daily , wrote .
This was the first Concorde crash after three decades of service .
PARIS , July 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A Concorde supersonic passenger plane of Air France crashed Tuesday afternoon soon after taking off from the Roissy international airport north of Paris , killing all 109 passengers and crew on board and four people on the ground , said the French Interior Ministry and rescuers .
Air France said that when the Concorde took off , its left reactor was on fire .

Tuesday 's flight to New York , with 33 of the 100 seats filled , was more than two hours late departing .
Its older relation has 100 seats , can manage only 4,000 miles and is 25 per cent slower .
British Airways insists that demand for seats on its Concorde has not dropped off after the Air France crash a week ago , despite a series of embarrassing problems since then with the British fleet of supersonic jets .
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single day 's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on July 25 , killing 113 people .
On Tuesday , British Airways -- the only airline flying the supersonic jets at the moment since the French fleet is grounded for now -- said Concorde traffic was comparable in recent days to the same time period in 1999 .
Some days this year are worse , but the airline pointed to one recent post-crash Concorde flight from New York that arrived with 82 passengers , compared to 32 on the same date a year ago .
The first plane assigned to the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed on a recently replaced engine , and another Concorde was rolled out .
On Saturday , emergency services were out on the runway to attend to the landing of a Concorde at Heathrow after a report of a loud bang in an engine .
The day 's second flight got only as far as Gander , Newfoundland , where it made an emergency landing after fumes that smelled like fuel got into the cabin .
The French disaster was the first in 25 years of commercial operations for Concorde .
But because the Concorde makes far fewer flights than most aircraft , that one crash gave it one of the worst safety records for passenger aircraft .
Since there have only been 80,000 Concorde flights in a quarter century , the aircraft now has a rate of 12.5 fatal incidents per million flights , according to according to www . AirSafe . com , a Web site that tracks safety data .
ABOARD THE CONCORDE _ Ninety minutes out of Heathrow , I press my nose against the porthole-sized window and gaze upon the distant world below .
Except for a handful of astronauts and military pilots , we Concorde passengers are flying higher and faster than any other humans .
Three decades after it first punched through the sound barrier , Concorde remains , in every meaningful sense , the pinnacle of commercial air travel .
In an age when flying increasingly resembles travel by Greyhound bus _ at least for those in coach _ Concorde is a throaty , head -turning , envy-inducing Lamborghini .
`` In a very real sense , Concorde was our Apollo program , '' said Mike Bannister , the chief Concorde pilot for British Airways .
Concorde made its maiden test flight in the spring of 1969 as Apollo 11 was fueling up for its rendezvous with the Sea of Tranquility .
Just as it 's becoming increasingly unlikely that we 'll be sending anyone back to the moon anytime soon , it 's also looking as if Concorde may be our one and only chance to fly faster than the speed of sound .
One of the joys of flying Concorde is looking down and seeing a jumbo jet on the same flight path 5 miles below .
But noise and environmental concerns severely constrained Concorde 's market .
By most estimates , it costs an airline five to eight times as much to fly a passenger across the Atlantic aboard Concorde as in a modern jumbo , such as a Boeing 777 or Airbus A340 .
At Heathrow Airport 's frenetic Terminal 4 , I stride smugly past the subsonic riffraff in their long , snaking lines and continue to the far end of the concourse , where Concorde has an exclusive check-in counter .
`` Would you like to see Concorde ? ''
As chubby jumbo jets waddle past on the tarmac , I ca n't help but notice how much the dart-shaped , delta-winged Concorde resembles the Pan Am spaceship in `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey . ''
After years of flying in the cavernous bellies of jumbo jets , I 'm startled at how compact the cabin seems .
There are all sorts of goodies stuffed into the seat back : Every passenger gets a complimentary Wedgwood Concorde ashtray and a leather portfolio filled with embossed Concorde stationery , an elegant Concorde pen and a suitable- for-framing certificate attesting that we have indeed broken the sound barrier .
Concorde has been taking off from Heathrow twice a day for the last 23 years , and it still draws a crowd .
It 's the vertical speed indicator , which flickers crazily for a moment as a shock wave moves past the Concorde 's outside sensor plate .
The wines aboard Concorde are extraordinary _ the Champagne is rotated among selections that include 1990 Dom Perignon and 1988 Tattinger , Comtes de Champagne _ but I notice that I seem to be the only one imbibing .
As we hit Mach 2 , the blase Concorde regulars around me wave off the bubbly and ask for Evian water .
On a Concorde flight in the early 1990s , Paul McCartney played his guitar and led his fellow passengers in a sing-along of Beatles songs .
Two years ago Brad Faxon , a member of the U.S . Ryder Cup team , sank a putt that ran the length of the plane 's cabin .
Someone who did better at high school algebra than I figured out that since the Concorde was moving at 1,330 mph , the ball traveled 8.5 miles , a world record .
My favorite Concorde story involves rock artist Phil Collins .
The other stars had to choose one or the other , but Collins performed at the opening of the London concert , hopped the Concorde to New York and arrived in Philadelphia in time to play the end of the U.S . show .
Concorde takes off in darkness but travels so fast it catches up with the sun .
NEW YORK _ The flight may not be as comfortable as business class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies _ or any movies , for that matter _ but crossing the Atlantic in just over three hours on the supersonic Concorde , versus seven to nine hours on standard jets , is well worth the cost and relative discomfort , Concorde passengers said Wednesday .
In the aftermath of Tuesday 's crash of a chartered Air France Concorde outside Paris , killing all 109 people on the airplane and four people on the ground , most members of the elite club that is the Concorde 's clientele had few qualms about flying the jet again .
`` When I heard about the crash , obviously I was horrified , '' said John Demsey , president of Mac Cosmetics , who flies on the Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris Wednesday on his way to the island of Capri .
His trip was delayed after Air France suspended all its Concorde flights until the airline is convinced the planes are safe .
British Airways , the only other airline that flies the Concorde , resumed its New York to London service Wednesday after having canceled some flights Tuesday .
Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde , which costs more than $ 10,000 for a full-fare roundtrip ticket , described as a business tool .
Air France says two-thirds of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business , while the rest are celebrities , the superrich or vacationers like members of the German tour group who died in Tuesday 's crash .
For business executives , the advantage of the Concorde , which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and , at 1,350 mph , twice as fast , is not just the time saved in the air .
British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel .
Concorde passengers can arrive a half hour before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and immigration .
Celebrities like the Concorde 's exclusivity because it separates them from the common folk on commercial flights .
The Concorde 's speed allows executives to put in a full day of work in London , hop on the 7 p.m . Concorde and arrive back in New York the same day at 6 p.m .
`` I certainly do n't take it for the luxury , '' said Emmanuel A . Kampouris , former chairman of American Standard Companies , who had just arrived on the 7 p.m . British Airways Concorde from London Wednesday .
The only reason he flew the Concorde Wednesday was because he had a meeting in London Wednesday and another in New York Thursday .
The Concorde also allows travelers to Europe to arrive early enough to connect to other destinations the same day .
Indeed , the Concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the Continent in the afternoon .
Besides , one of the Concorde 's dirty secrets is that few of its regulars pay the top fare of more than $ 10,000 roundtrip .
Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde .
`` It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to swim , '' Richard Nigosian , president of Bond Street Travel in Manhattan , said of the customers he books on the Concorde .
Britain 's decision on Tuesday to ground the Concorde following the first fatal crash of the supersonic transport plane probably marks the end of the line for what was almost certainly the loftiest niche in commercial aviation history .
Concorde was never a significant factor in aviation except for those willing to pay up to $ 11,000 for a round-trip ticket between New York and London or Paris .
Concorde 's conversion to museum status will be as much a matter of economics as safety .
Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour , Concorde was largely restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic boom on earthlings .
Concorde 's retirement may be unique in transportation annals for lowering maximum speeds .
Supersonic speed has remained a formidable barrier for most airlines , and no successor to Concorde is within sight .
LONDON , January 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A new version of Concorde is being developed as manufacturers realized the increasing costs of operating the world 's fastest commercial jet will one day exceed the profits it makes , according to a Sunday Times report .
The new version , Concorde Two , will carry 300 passengers , have a range of more than 6,500 miles and travel at two and a half times the speed of sound .
Under the new design , Concorde Two will have a cockpit at the rear of the plane close to the tailfin , which will spell an end for Concorde 's 's distinctive drooping nose .
At present , Concorde registers 120 decibels on take-off , louder than a rock concert .
Flights from London to Los Angeles and Tokyo are important sources of revenue , but are beyond Concorde 's capabilities .

With flames and smoke streaking from its engines , an Air France Concorde carrying German tourists to New York for a Caribbean cruise crashed into a hotel outside Paris shortly after takeoff Tuesday .

British businessman Darren Atkins told SKY TV news he was aboard another aircraft behind the Concorde on the tarmac .
The passengers had been on a trip meant to savor : champagne on the Concorde , then a leisurely cruise on the MS Deutschland through the Panama Canal to Ecuador .
Air France officials have said in the past that their current fleet was fit to fly safely until 2007 .

PARIS _ A New York -bound supersonic Concorde jet carrying 109 people crashed into a small hotel shortly after takeoff here Tuesday afternoon , killing all those on board and at least four people on the ground .
One other Concorde had been grounded in London last week because of cracks in its wing .
The crash came a day after British Airways acknowledged it had grounded one of its seven Concorde jets at Heathrow Airport in London because cracks were detected in its wings .
Air France also found cracks in the wings of its six - plane Concorde fleet , but on Monday assured passengers the cracks were the result of normal wear and tear and did not make the jet any less safe .
Round-trip seats on the Paris - New York Concorde cost $ 9,000 , about 25 percent more than normal first-class fares .
The NTSB was invited becuase the Concorde provides regular scheduled service to the United States .
The NTSB conducted two preliminary investigations in recent years involving the Concorde .
ATLANTA - Traffic came to a halt around Hartsfield International Airport as the Concorde taxied to the runway for its first-ever takeoff from Atlanta .
Another chartered Concorde landed here in 1997 carrying European vacationers on an around-the-world dash .
The agreement does not allow Delta to book seats on Air France 's Concorde flights , though .
A Delta spokesman said Tuesday the airline has hoped to expand the `` code share '' deal to include Concorde flights .
The supersonic Concorde 's visits to Atlanta demonstrate the public fascination , economic obstacles and environmental controversies the Concorde has evoked during its 31 years of flight .
The Concorde has been a perennial money loser for Air France and British Airways even though almost all 100 of each flight 's seats are typically filled by passengers paying nearly $ 10,000 apiece .
Each Concorde burns more than its own weight in fuel during every trans-Atlantic crossing .
That 's more than a B747-400 , which travels at slightly less than half the Concorde 's speed but can transport four times as many people and far more cargo .
The Concorde had never had a fatal accident before Tuesday .
But a former flight dispatcher for Air France said the planes fly at the edge of their aerodynamic capabilities all the time .
Also , the aerodynamic characteristics of the Concorde 's triangle-shaped delta wing make it unstable at slow speeds _ especially in a situation like the Paris crash , when one or more engines apparently failed on takeoff .
Concorde wings do n't have slats on the leading edges or traditional flaps on the trailing edges to aid low-speed handling .
A Concorde typically flies at altitudes up to 60,000 feet _ about twice that of most passenger jets .
And it takes just three hours , 23 minutes to fly from New York to Paris .
`` Flying has been a big part of my life , and the Concorde was my only chance to go supersonic , '' said the Skylarks ' Vason , 70 , a former Air Force bomber and transport pilot .

GONESSE , France _ A supersonic Air France Concorde carrying mainly German tourists bound for a cruise ship in New York crashed in flames shortly after take-off from Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris Tuesday , killing all 109 passengers and crew on board as well as at least four people on the ground .
It was the only crash of a Concorde since the world 's first supersonic passenger plane went into commercial operation in 1976 .
He added that the Concorde that crashed Tuesday entered service in 1980 and had undergone a mechanical check up as recently as last Friday .
Deilmann , the company 's chief executive , said the Concorde 's passengers were scheduled to join a luxury cruise ship , `` Deutschland , '' Tuesday evening in New York at the start of a 16-day tour of the Caribbean , traveling through the Panama Canal to Manta in Ecuador .
A photograph of the ill-fated Concorde in the air , taken by a young Hungarian plane -spotter , showed flames stretching some 60 feet behind the aircraft .
Eric Udel , a New York musician who had just finished touring Europe with the Blue Brothers jazz band , said he looked up and saw the Concorde on fire .
On Tuesday night , the French transport minister , Jean-Claude Gayssot , said he had asked the civil aviation authority to cancel all Concorde flights Wednesday .
In London , a spokesman for British Airways , the only airline apart from Air France to fly the plane , said that Tuesday evening 's flights to and from New York had also been canceled .
But a spokesman for the British Civil Aviation Board said it had no intention of grounding the Concorde .
Earlier this month , British Airways grounded one of its seven Concordes after cracks were found in its wings , but the remaining six in its supersonic fleet continue to fly .
`` Like all of you , '' he told reporters , `` I have just heard the news of the crash of the Concorde outside Paris , and I wanted to extend the deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those who are lost. ''
Although Concorde only makes the return flight to New York three times a day _ once from Paris and twice from London _ its aura of romance and luxury has made it popular for charter by travel groups catering to the well-heeled .
On at least three occasions , the rubber tires on the Concorde 's landing gear have exploded upon landing .

Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde .
`` It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to swim , '' Richard Nigosian , president of Bond Street Travel in Manhattan , said of the customers he books on the Concorde .

BINTAN ISLAND , Riau -LRB- JP -RRB- : On a warm May afternoon above a forested cliff , Ria Bintan Club Med Resort executives gathered to celebrate the resort 's first summer season with 150 corporate clients and 230 journalists from around the world .
General manager Mehdi Serrour and Club Med CEO Philippe Bourgougnov played hosts to the guests enjoying the resort 's lush grasslands , clear waters and above all , the complimentary three-day , two -night stay at the resort .
At the gathering , Serrour would not say what the extravagant Club Med cost to build , but a corporate client figured that the cost could have reached more than Rp 15 billion .
The Ria Bintan Club Med Resort -LRB- RBCM -RRB- , built on 20 hectares , has guests enjoying a nearby 218 -hole golf course , which does not belong to Club Med , an exclusive beach , beautiful architecture and aquamarine waters of the South China Sea .
Its hotel list includes the Rasa Indah , Sedona Bintan Lagoon , Bintan Lagoon Beach and Resort , RBCM , Banyan Tree Bintan , Mana Mana Beach Club and the Nirwana Garden Resort .
It would n't be Club Med if we cut costs .
I 'd say we 'll see more and more of the Club Med logo ...
`` Europeans , because they come from so far off , take full advantage of their time and vacation here. ''
Serrour reiterated that Club Med was not currently focusing on finance .
Club Med around the world boasts 76,000 beds , 12 villages in Asia , 89 in Europe and 17 in North America .
At the press conference on May 9 , Bourgougnov , Club Med 's CEO , said 14 percent of Club Med 's business came from Asian general managers .
He lists the facilities worldwide -- among them about 14,000 service staff , 40 different sports and 950 sailboats .

Cigarettes are her vice and , periodically , she 'll step out into the afternoon cold for a `` burn one '' break , a phrase Franz Kafka surely did n't hear in the coffee houses of Prague .
It 's a world as far from Franz Kafka as the Yukon River is from Prague , but in one passage Kimberley joins the crimes of the New World to her ancestor 's ancient sigh .
City councilors named a square after Prague 's literary son , Franz Kafka , on Tuesday despite earlier protest from the district 's mayor who said the move would have terrified the writer .
Kafka .
Kimberley Kafka is the first cousin - twice removed of Franz Kafka , and is herself a published writer of nearly 20 years .
It seemed like the only thing I could do without too much of a struggle , '' the 42-year-old Kafka says .
`` I started writing stories in kindergarten ; I had n't even made any connection to Franz Kafka . ''
Kafka works out of a tiny attic office where the furniture is old , made of wood , and passed down from the non- Kafka side of the family .
Wearing jeans and a large purple sweater , Kimberley Kafka appears far more defined by her upbeat , American first name than her dark , haunted last name .
Only in college did she learn there even was a Franz Kafka .
As both his fiction and his diaries revealed , Kafka was the most tortured of artists , touched by everything from Jewish despair to the bureaucratic state .
In Kafka 's first novel , `` Amerika , '' a teen-age European caught up in a sex scandal is shipped by his parents to the New World .
He 's a typically passive Kafka character , dragged through a variety of jobs and friends in the East before hitching up with a theater company and boarding a train to Oklahoma .
According to several biographies , `` Amerika `` was based in part on Kimberley Kafka 's grandfather , Otto Kafka .
He was Franz Kafka 's first cousin and he apparently ran away from home as a teen-ager , worked on a ship and settled in the United States .
Franz Kafka never spent a moment in America and he did n't finish the novel .
Whatever Kimberley Kafka knows about her father 's side of the family , she 's learned from books .
By the time her father , Philip Kafka , was born , the past had been wiped out with the savagery of a pogrom .
My mother was Christian and my dad was not born into any religion .
Philip Kafka ended up in Jacksonville , Fla . , where Frances Kimberley Kafka was born .
Kafka read like a demon , everything from children 's stories to Shakespeare .
No Franz Kafka books were in the house and at no time was it pointed out that her father had a cousin with a kindred passion .
Neither her parents , her friends nor her teachers ever mentioned Kafka .
A fellow student asked if she was related to THAT Kafka .
She maintained for the longest time that there was absolutely no connection , '' Kafka says .
Kimberley Kafka was straightening out a bookcase in the living room when she came upon a packet of letters to her father at the back of a shelf .
They were from a biographer , asking questions about Otto Kafka .
`` Before I was born my mother wanted another child .
Kafka has never met her biological mother and does n't want to .
Had Kimberley looked carefully at a picture of the young Franz Kafka she might have suspected sooner .
`` She was furious , '' recalls novelist Madison Smartt Bell , a friend of Kafka 's and a fellow Hollins student .
And while most teachers avoided mentioning Franz Kafka in the classroom , at least one could n't help himself .
The professor was very old at that point -- he had to be in his early 80s , and he was a Kafka fanatic .
It cracked me up ; he would be lecturing to the class and his eyes would be going over a line and instead of saying , 'Hans Castorp ' he would be saying , 'Hans Kafka -- I mean Castorp -- excuse me Miss Kafka ! '
In college , she read her first Kafka book , `` The Trial . ''
Kimberley Kafka lives within as few boundaries as possible ; her ancestor imagined a world of closed doors or doors that simply opened to other doors .
Out of obligation rather than pleasure , she read Kafka .
Kafka began working on `` True North `` in 1997 and completed her first draft the following year .
Kafka has never read `` Amerika , '' but `` True North `` also tells the story of a character who flees to the West .
The small plaza in the heart of downtown , just off the famous Old Town Square , was named after Kafka because his house stood there before it was demolished in 1911 .
The mayor of the first district , Jan Buergermeister , protested the proposal in February , arguing that naming a square after Kafka would go against the very essence of the writer 's work .
Kafka is best known for his absurd novels like The Trial or The Castle .

But the changes have not improved the piece , and _ like the Hitchcock film _ it looses steam and falls apart .
Her character is poorly written , and she seems such a shallow , spoiled ninny that she fails to be the sympathetic center she 's supposed to be .
Also fun is the film 's production design , which goes less for a Hitckcockian look and feel than for the gaudy , high melodrama style of producer Ross Hunter and such over-produced kitsch classics of the late '50s and early '60s as `` Midnight Lace , '' `` Portrait in Black '' and `` Back Street .

Lynette Woodard , the all-time collegiate scoring leader and first woman to play for the Harlem Globetrotters , today announced she is retiring from professional basketball and returning to the University of Kansas as an assistant coach .
But Larry Bird could play basketball , and Monday he received the ultimate confirmation of that when he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame .
But he had a tremendous knowledge of the game of basketball , and he was settled in the way he played .
`` His love for the game and how effective he was at playing basketball kind of made him understand that basketball had to be a big part of his life , '' Daniels said. ''
At the Basketball Hall of Fame , which draws visitors from around the world , you learn that Dr . James Naismith invented the sport in 1891 to vanquish winter blahs .
`` We are really hoping to play here. ''
Jackson said that Cuban sports officials seemed very warm about his proposal to have the team visit later this year , play the national team in Havana and play exhibition games in three or four other cities outside the capital .
He said he hopes that a Cuban national team will be able to play the Globetrotters at Madison Square Garden in New York .
Naismith wanted to give bored students at the YMCA International Training School -LRB- now Springfield College -RRB- an exciting game they could play indoors with minimal equipment : a soccer ball and two peach baskets .
Within a few years alumni of the school , most of whom became YMCA directors , had introduced Naismith 's new sport around the country and to many parts of the world .
Historical displays focus on the game 's early years , noting , for instance , the role of the Harlem Globetrotters in popularizing the sport .

His voice grows quieter and more cautious , but still he discusses his rise from the depths of tennis frustration _ which at one point had him convinced he was through with the sport _ to the peak of becoming the fourth and final member of the Australian Davis Cup team .
The feeling of camaraderie in team tennis intrigues him , so he wanted to play a part , no matter how small .
He played tennis every day until it got dark , and suddenly he started winning .
Rain delayed the first day of play at the U.S . Tennis Center in New York .
Capriati was leading Gagliardi 6-4 , 1 -0 when rain delayed the first day of play at the U.S . Open at the U.S . Tennis Center in New York .
Tennis was reintroduced as an Olympic sport only in 1988 , after a 64-year absence .
Capriati joined a field that includes French Open champion Steffi Graf , defending Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna , Anna Kournikova and Amanda Coetzer , last year 's runner-up here to Graf .
Capriati , 23 , was beaten in the second round at Wimbledon on Wednesday by Seda Noorlander of the Netherlands 6-1 , 6-3 .
This will be Capriati 's fifth appearance in the exhibition event , which she won in 1991 and '93 .
`` Sport is in general .
Stolle has garnered world rankings as high as 50 in singles play and 14 in doubles .
Suddenly a sport that had never been a top priority became fun .
`` He really got me thinking in ways I had n't thought before and he really got a lot out of me for 2 1/2 years , where I felt like I was going to play , '' Stolle remembers .
Which he did , at the US Open , and emerged successful in doubles play .
`` You play these matches and sometimes you get so involved that it means everything , '' Stolle said .
A few years later , Davenport feared Capriati , the image : `` I 'm gon na be careful .
Davenport said , `` It 's really strange _ and great for her _ that Jennifer and I wound up in the Australian Open semifinals .
But Davenport , the 6-foot-3-inch Wimbledon champion , was determined to be an added problem herself , and held together under a fierce Capriati assault to power her way into Thursday 's final , 6-2 , 7-6 -LRB- 7-4 -RRB- .
`` Jennifer kept me on my heels the way she was slugging , '' said Davenport , who was toppled by Capriati 's rugged forehand in the 10th game of the second set as she served for the victory at 5-4 .
Capriati , who has risen from No . 101 to No . 21 in two years , was matching Davenport 's firepower , shot for shot .
But in the tiebreaker , it was Davenport 's harmless-looking , changeup kicker second serve that did Capriati in , making two vital points .
Capriati overhit them , the first a backhand that looked a winner that would have given her a minibreak _ but it just missed the sideline so that Davenport was at 3-3 .
The lone mini , to 5-4 , went to Davenport on Capriati 's error , concluding a blistering exchange of 21 strokes .
Davenport fooled Capriati with another slow 66 miles per hour kicker to 6 -4 .
I did n't know what to do , '' said Capriati , who plunked a last forehand into the net , ending her 82-minute challenge that roused a late-morning gathering of 12,000 to constant shouts of `` Come on , Jennifer ! ''
Nine years had passed since the ill-starred Capriati last ventured this far in a major championship , the US Open semifinal that she barely lost to Monica Seles .
In 23 minutes , Davenport had pocketed the opening set , running up a 5 - 1 lead and splintered Capriati 's serve to start the second .
The depth of Davenport 's weighty ground strokes and her dynamite serve killed Capriati .
But Capriati , ever a fighter , came roaring back to score her first service break 2-1 at the half-hour mark , subsided 2-4 , then began to outhit her faltering foe to catch her at 4-4 .
`` Jennifer had me going .
Jennifer Capriati was a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1991 , while Lindsay Davenport was struggling through the junior draw .
Capriati also was playing in the U.S . Open semifinals in '91 , one year before Davenport won the junior title on those same courts .
But though Davenport did n't turn pro until three years after her colleague _ and with much less fanfare _ the 24-year-old Californian has long bypassed Capriati , accomplishing things the former phenom still dreams about .
On Monday , Davenport again showed her dominance , ending Capriati 's best Wimbledon since 1993 with a 6-3 , 6-3 victory .
Capriati made three Grand Slam semifinal appearances in 1990 and '91 , then reached the semis this year in Australia .
Capriati , who had lost in the second round in both of her other Wimbledon appearances since leaving the Tour at the end of 1993 , played well in Monday 's first set , losing only her first service game .
The 6 - 2 -LCB- Davenport drilled seven aces past Capriati and had 18 unreturnable serves .
`` Hopefully , I 'll have another opportunity to play better , at least play the best I can. ''

Under the coaching of Harold Solomon , she feels her game keeps improving .
This is , according to the experts who coach at or play it , the toughest Grand Slam event to crack , and , according to most of them , the one likeliest to break a player down instead of providing him or her with a breakthrough .
`` It 's the most difficult one to win , but that 's what makes it the biggest in the world , because it lends itself to the best level of tennis at crunch time , '' said Brad Gilbert , the coach of the 1994 Open champion Andre Agassi , who actually expresses a preference for this Grand Slam event and its frenetic locale .
Sampras ' coach , Paul Annacone , a former player who dealt the four -time champion John McEnroe the only first-round Open loss of his career in 1986 , said the Open `` epitomizes the hustle-bustle and hoopla of New York . ''
According to both parties , they did so because Capriati wanted a full-time coach and Solomon wanted to spend more time with his family in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . , and less time on the road .

Sears , Roebuck & Co . reported Thursday its first-quarter profits jumped 36 percent as its credit-card business improved , offsetting weak sales at its auto centers and department stores .
The nation 's largest department store company , based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates , reported it cut delinquency rates and charge-offs in its profitable credit card business .
Now the playful sexual attitude that infuses the print campaign _ popular enough to generate sales of about 220,000 copies of each quarterly issue of the magalogue _ is coming to life in commercials that will run on cable television and on monitors in Abercrombie & Fitch stores nationwide .
Still , the Abercrombie & Fitch campaign , which is created by Shahid & Co . in New York in collaboration with Weber , is notable for its continuous baring of buff bodies _ mostly male _ with a devil-may-care style and tongue-in-cheek tone .
`` We 're a life-style brand , projecting inside the store and outside the store the life style of a very specific target customer , the 18-to-22-year-old American college student , '' said Michael S . Jeffries , chairman and chief executive at Abercrombie & Fitch in Reynoldsburg , Ohio .
As a result , a children 's division with stores called Abercrombie is being developed ; there are 14 now with plans to open 20 more in the fall .
There are about 190 Abercrombie & Fitch stores , with an additional 30 or so planned to open in the fall .
Print ads to promote the magalogues , which run in Interview and Out magazines in addition to Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair , have an estimated annual budget of $ 2 million ; Abercrombie & Fitch does not discuss the costs of producing the magalogues and catalogs .
WEST PALM BEACH , Fla . _ Is Abercrombie & Fitch everywhere , or does it just seem that way ?
Listen to LFO 's lilting single `` Summer Girls , '' at No . 3 on the Billboard singles chart : `` I like girls that wear Abercrombie & Fitch ...
And this fall Abercrombie will unveil its first TV commercials , as well as guest-star on the hyped Fox show `` Get Real . ''
Costume designer Kathleen Detoro chose Abercrombie 's blue jeans and cargo pants to give the teen-age cast members of `` Get Real '' an up -to-the-minute look .
Based in Reynoldsburg , Ohio , Abercrombie & Fitch has enjoyed an incredible run , posting net sales of $ 199 million in the second quarter of 1999 , a 74 percent increase in net income from the previous year and its 28th consecutive quarter of record sales and earnings .
Abercrombie encourages its youthful sales force to adopt the casual look it 's hawking , meaning clerks wear baseball caps and flip-flops and generally look ready for a game of touch football .
It sued American Eagle Outfitters , alleging that the rival clothier copied A & F 's image and business practices .
A federal judge threw out the suit in July , but Abercrombie plans to appeal .
Abercrombie & Fitch began life in 1892 as a high-end camping , fishing and hunting gear store in New York City .
Abercrombie sold 15 percent of its shares to the public three years ago , and spun-off completely from Limited Inc . in May 1998 .
All the while , Abercrombie has steadily grown , from 25 stores in 1988 to almost 200 now .
But from her vantage point as Greek reporter at The Independent Florida Alligator at the University of Florida , senior Corrine Simon does n't see a huge Abercrombie presence , `` not any more than any other style on campus . ''
It 's a different story back at Simon 's home in Raleigh , N.C . `` Let me put it this way _ my 14-year-old sister loves Abercrombie , my 17-year-old sister is over it .
The Fitch look does fetch a pretty penny .
On a recent Saturday , the bulk of shoppers emerging from the Abercrombie store were n't college coeds but teen-age girls such as Kim Staruk , a senior at Cardinal Newman High School .
So much that she also owns a pair of fashionably frayed Abercrombie jeans .
Both were carting bags of shirts and jackets because Abercrombie is `` different from what other people wear '' in Melbourne , where high school girls frequent Wet Seal and Contempo .

In the last five years , Abercrombie , of Reynoldsburg , Ohio , has seen 17 percent annualized growth in same-store sales _ those for stores open at least a year .
Stores look like clubs , with leather chairs and sofas , tables and lamps .
`` There are enough attractive malls to absorb at least 500 stores , '' said Pam Milunovich , manager of the Solomon Brothers Small Cap Growth fund .
Now the playful sexual attitude that infuses the print campaign _ popular enough to generate sales of about 220,000 copies of each quarterly issue of the magalogue _ is coming to life in commercials that will run on cable television and on monitors in Abercrombie & Fitch stores nationwide .
As a result , a children 's division with stores called Abercrombie is being developed ; there are 14 now with plans to open 20 more in the fall .
But sales declined up to 4 percent in September at Gap stores , which still account for roughly 35 percent of the company 's revenue .
More significantly , Old Navy , the fun , lower-cost clothier begun by Gap a mere five years ago , has become so popular so quickly that it is challenging Gap stores ' primacy .
Still , the 1,021 stores under the flagship Gap name must start to perform better or risk becoming dead weight .
And the stock , while down more than 25 percent from its July peak , looks rich to some analysts unless the company can return to double-digit growth , for which it needs the Gap stores .
Leroy , describing internal studies of openings of Old Navy stores in Gap markets , said : `` After the first year , the Gap store will do better than our projections , because Old Navy has driven more customers into the market .
Until last year , he had been enamored mostly of Old Navy , but he is now convinced that Gap stores need his full attention .

But Prince Genji is a central figure in Japanese culture , and he never had a wit of trouble with the law _ perhaps in part because he never existed .
Yet if Prince Genji is an unusual cultural icon , his latest chronicler is if anything even more startling .
Jakucho Setouchi , a 77-year-old Buddhist nun with shaven head and twinkling eyes , has translated `` Tale of Genji '' into modern Japanese and turned it into a huge best seller .
`` So , yes , ` Tale of Genji ' is relevant to today 's people .
`` Tale of Genji '' has been translated into modern Japanese before , by some of the nation 's greatest writers , but the other translations have tended to be in formal Japanese that today 's young people find largely indigestible or even unintelligible .
So Ms . Setouchi , who was already a famous author and renowned for her racy novels , decided to tackle `` Genji . ''
A `` Genji '' play has come out , and Ms . Setouchi is a television star on the national lecture circuit .
Her temple _ for all its idyllic gardens and lovely antiques _ seems to have compromised its serenity with all the fans coming to see Japan 's most famous nun .
Janine Beichman , an American who is a professor of Japanese literature at Daito Bunka University in Tokyo , says sales of the latest `` Tale of Genji '' translation reflect both the greatness of the original story and the reputation of Ms . Setouchi .
`` Tale of Genji '' was written at the beginning of the 11th century by a brilliant young widow , Shikibu Murasaki , who was governess to the empress and had attracted the -LRB- apparently unwanted -RRB- attentions of the empress 's father .
`` Tale of Genji '' was read aloud to the emperor , and its mix of plot and heartache and psychology _ a bit like Jane Austen _ have made it a hit ever since .
`` ` Tale of Genji ' is filled with psychological themes , '' said Hideyo Ueda , the director of the Japan Classic Literature Research Institute in Tokyo .
Ms . Setouchi argues , in contrast to many other critics , that the key figures in `` Tale of Genji '' are the women whom the prince uses and discards .
While Genji 's liaisons are normally described as seductions , Ms . Setouchi scoffs at that .
`` Men are very free now to have girlfriends , and women to have boyfriends , and it 's getting back to the way it was in Genji 's time , '' Ms . Setouchi said .
The inevitable nominees from the distant past would include Queen Elizabeth I , Joan of Arc and Shikibu Murasaki , whose `` Tales of Genji '' was the first realistic novel .

According to David Stenn 's `` Bombshell : The Life and Death of Jean Harlow , '' -LRB- Doubleday , 1993 -RRB- the film turned out to be Harlow 's most successful , grossing $ 3.3 million , more than any other movie in 1937 .
7 . Jean Harlow _ In her brief , seven-year career , this first of Hollywood 's blonde bombshells established a new kind of naturalistic , unaffected , if-you've-got-it-flaunt-it brand of sexuality that is as unique and appealing today as it was when her early death stunned the world in 1936 .
