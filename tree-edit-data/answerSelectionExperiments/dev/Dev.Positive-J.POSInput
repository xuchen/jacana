The test , developed by private and government researchers , detects the presence of abnormal proteins called prions that cause a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , or TSE .

The Concorde , which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph , has been considered among the world 's safest planes .
By comparison , the Concorde , the fastest commercial aircraft , has a top speed of about 1,800 mph .
Someone who did better at high school algebra than I figured out that since the Concorde was moving at 1,330 mph , the ball traveled 8.5 miles , a world record .
The Concorde flies at some 55,000 feet , nearly twice ordinary passenger jets , and travels at nearly 1,350 miles per hour , twice the speed of sound .
And the plane 's extraordinary speed of 1,350 mph comes at a price : The Concorde is a gas guzzler .
The Concorde , which can fly at 1,350 miles per hour at some 60,000 feet above sea-level , has long been regarded by France as proof of its technological prowess .
For business executives , the advantage of the Concorde , which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and , at 1,350 mph , twice as fast , is not just the time saved in the air .
