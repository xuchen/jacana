An estimated 50,000 Americans practice Wicca , a form of polytheistic nature worship .
The inch- thick chaplain handbook includes a five -page primer on Wicca , described as `` a reconstruction of the Nature worship of tribal Europe . ''
With its lack of a central hierarchy and rigid rules , the earth -based religion of Wicca draws members from a mix of movements : feminists , environmentalists and New Age seekers who worship the gods and goddesses of nature by casting sacred circles and celebrating the changing seasons .
With Kiernan , at least , Bush is still paying for a statement he made last year that Wicca _ whose practitioners call themselves witches and believe in the dual deity of god and goddess _ is not a religion and should not be practiced on military bases .

The U.N . team spent a week in Cambodia to assess existing evidence for a possible trial of top Khmer Rouge leaders held responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during the Maoist guerrillas ' 1975-79 rule of Cambodia .
Key events in the history of Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge movement : ___ _ 1949-52 : Saloth Sar , later known as Pol Pot , goes to Paris on government scholarship and becomes absorbed with communist ideology .
1978 : Vietnam invades Cambodia to stop Khmer Rouge border attacks .
On the 25th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia , Prime Minister Hun Sen said Monday an agreement may finally be at hand to set up a court to prosecute the movement 's former leaders whose reign of terror killed 1.7 million people .
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders ended their six-day grand tour of the country Sunday and returned to a remote jungle town that has become a well-guarded haven for defectors from the Communist movement , officials said .
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia _ As passions rise over whether to put former leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial , King Norodom Sihanouk volunteered Monday to join them in the dock to answer for his past associations with the brutal communist movement .
The two men were allowed to tour the capital , Phnom Penh , then visit the seaside resort of Sihanoukville and the temples of Angkor before returning last Monday to Pailin , an enclave of former Khmer Rouge in a remote area of western Cambodia .
U.S . officials said one compromise would call for the defectors , Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea , to be charged with crimes against humanity that occurred from 1975 to 1979 , when the Khmer Rouge under the leadership of Pol Pot ruled Cambodia _ and not for crimes that took place afterward .
Khieu Samphan , who was the head of state of the Khmer Rouge government , and Nuon Chea , who as Pol Pot 's second in command was known as `` Brother No . 2 , '' defected late last month after spending most of the last two decades in jungle redoubts along Cambodia 's border with Thailand .
Pol Pot died in April in a Khmer Rouge guerrilla camp in western Cambodia , apparently of natural causes .
He was the titular head of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas during the civil war from 1970 to 1975 , and then was briefly head of state of Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge period .
Three international jurists hired by the United Nations are in Cambodia , looking at the evidence against the most important Khmer Rouge leaders and assessing the feasibility of trials .
NEW YORK _ After months of wavering , Cambodia Friday officially rejected U.N . recommendations to convene a tribunal to try surviving senior Khmer Rouge leaders , seeming to kill any chance of an international court .
Hor Nam Hong , Cambodia 's foreign minister , flew to New York and informed U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan that Cambodia would hold a trial of Khmer Rouge leaders in its own courts .
The official rejection was announced days before the secretary general was scheduled to make public the recommendation of a panel of experts that the United Nations convene a tribunal to try a dozen or more senior Khmer Rouge leaders outside of Cambodia .
The Cambodian trial would cover the period from 1975 to 1979 when the Khmer Rouge governed Cambodia , taking the lives of 2 million Cambodians .
But Hor Nam Hong said Friday that with the help of international jurists , Cambodia could try the Khmer Rouge in the country where `` we were all their victims . ''
Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia was one of the modern world 's most brutal regimes .
Ieng Sary with several thousand Khmer Rouge forces broke away from the guerrilla movement and crossed over to the government of Cambodia in August last year .
PHNOM PENH , December 26 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Cambodia 's Top Khmer Rouge political leader Khieu Samphan has surrendered to the government , a local radio reported Saturday .
In his letter , Hun Sen reiterated that `` We have never rejected the accountability of the Khmer Rouge leaders for the crimes of genocide in Cambodia . ''
`` We just want , however , to caution that any decision to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to justice must also take into full account the Cambodia 's need for peace , national reconciliation ... , '' he stressed .
`` Therefore , if improperly and heedlessly conducted , the trials of Khmer Rouge leaders would panic other former Khmer Rouge officers and its rank and file , who have already surrendered , into turning back to the jungle and renewing the guerrilla war in Cambodia , '' Hun Sen pointed out .
The U.N . experts came to Cambodia last November to investigate the Khmer Rouge issues and made the report to Kofi Annan .
UNITED NATIONS , May 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The agreement to try Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge may be near and the United Nations is going to send its chief legal counsel to the country to wrap up the details , U.N . spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Wednesday .

The Khmer Rouge seized Phnom Penh on April 17 , 1975 , and cut Cambodia off from the world .
Sihanouk was named head of state after the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 , but was locked in his palace by the communists as they embarked on their brutal attempt to create an agrarian utopia .

Bott 's work with quarks , an elementary particle found in protons and neutrons , has contributed to the string theory , the so-called `` theory of everything '' to explain the universe .
Dr . Henry Way Kendall , one of three physicists who shared a Nobel Prize for confirming that tiny particles called quarks were the basic building blocks of matter , died on Monday while on an underwater photography shoot in Wakulla Springs State Park , south of Tallahassee , Fla . He was 72 and lived in Sharon , Mass .
Kendall and his colleagues won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics for experiments that confirmed the existence of quarks , the infinitesimally tiny packets of energy that make up protons and neutrons , which were once thought to be matter 's fundamental particles .
`` It 's the denial of what understanding we have of the origin of the universe in terms of modern science , '' said Jerome Friedman , a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1990 for collaborating in the discovery of the subatomic particles called quarks and is the president of the American Physical Society .
In those first instants , scientists believe , subatomic particles called quarks and gluons roamed freely , rather than being locked inside the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei , as they seem to be now .
Its crucial component is the `` strange quark '' - one of six types of quarks , which are the tiniest building blocks of matter .
If `` strange stars '' are positively identified by Usov 's criteria , this would finally settle a major dispute in particle physics on the existence of matter composed of quarks - the most stable matter in the universe , the report said .
</A>
<A 38.2 >
In the current `` standard model '' of the universe , all matter is fundamentally made up of six particles called quarks -LRB- whimsically so named by the late Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann for James Joyce 's cryptic quotation `` Three Quarks for Muster Mark '' in Finnegan 's Wake -RRB- plus three electrons , tau particles , and muons , plus three kinds of neutrinos .
Among the major achievements in physics I was privileged to report were the discovery of the top quark at Fermilab _ the last of six quarks predicted by theory _ and the discovery in Japan that the elusive neutrino particle probably has some mass , a finding with profound implications for the fate of the universe .
</A>
<A 38.3 >
Their equations were vital in calculating the mass of the top quark , which was observed for the first time in 1995 at the Fermilab in the United States .
The bet , which won him dinner for four , was regarding the existence and mass of the top quark , an elementary particle discovered to much in 1995 .
The stupendous power of the Tevatron made possible the 1995 discovery of the top quark _ the last of six flavors of quarks predicted by the standard model theory of particle physics .
Mr . Kendall won the Nobel prize in physics in 1990 , along with Friedman and Richard Taylor of Stanford , for work done at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the 1960s that produced the first direct evidence for the existence of quarks _ tiny particles that combine in groups of three to form the subatomic particles , such as protons , from which matter is made .
The most conspicuous achievement of the Tevatron in its 14 years of operation was the discovery in 1995 of the `` top quark , '' which filled in the last blank space for six quarks allotted by a table of fundamental particles known as the Standard Model .

For much of the 1920s , Teapot Dome _ a classic tale of oil tycoons , $ 100 bills and a jailed Cabinet member _ was the talk of the nation .
It was the first trial of former Cabinet officials since the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s , and it was the first time in the country 's history that two former Cabinet officials were tried together .

But the scandal that really smeared the memory of President Warren Harding bubbled 75 years ago from Teapot Dome , a vast pool of oil below treeless sagebrush flats just south of here .

Syria 's ruling Baath party nominated Bashar Assad for president on Tuesday , making it virtually certain he will succeed his late father as leader of the country .
Addressing the closing session of the party 's congress , Bashar Assad vowed that Baath would remain faithful to the principles laid down by his father , President Hafez Assad .
Bashar Assad rejected suggestions that the Baath party , which has monopolized power since 1963 , was becoming antiquated .
The ruling Baath Party elected Bashar Assad to the post of secretary general of its executive on Saturday -- bringing the 34-year-old another step closer to taking over the presidency left vacant by his father 's death .
Since the June 10 death of his father , President Hafez Assad , the parliament , the Baath Party and state-controlled media have been promoting Bashar Assad as Syria 's next leader .
The state television also said that the leadership of the ruling Baath Party had voted unanimously to nominate Bashar Assad for the presidency .

As the seconds ticked away , there was mostly silence , a hush expectancy perhaps mindful of the terrible explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger in 1986 about 90 seconds into flight when the booster separation went awry .
