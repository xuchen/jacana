S	"entropy"	+	1.8.6.7.2	The second law of thermodynamics states that spontaneous processes, those requiring no outside input of energy, increase the entropy (disorder) of the universe.
S		-	1.8.2.1.5.3	For deltaG to be negative, either deltaH must be negative (the system gives up enthalpy and H decreases) or TdeltaS must be positive (the system gives up order and S increases), or both: When deltaH and TdeltaS are tallied, deltaG has a negative value (deltaG &lt; 0) for all spontaneous processes.

S		-	1.8.2.2.4.1	We can think of free energy as a measure of a system's instability: its tendency to change to a more stable state.
S		-	1.8.2.2.3.2	Because it has less free energy, the system in its final state is less likely to change and is therefore more stable than it was previously.
S		-	1.8.2.2.3.4	Unstable systems (top) are rich in free energy, G. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work.

A	"carbon dioxide"	"CO2"
S	"CO2"	+	1.10.1.2.1.1.1	One of the first clues to the mechanism of photosynthesis came from the discovery that the O2 given off by plants is derived from H2O and not from CO2.

A	"atherosclerosis"

Q	What process allows a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from concentrations in its environment?
A	"Active transport"
S	"Active transport"	+	1.7.4.1.2.1	Active transport enables a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from concentrations in its environment.
S		-	1.40.2.1.4.3	For example, even though the bass conforms to the temperature of the surrounding water, the solute concentration in its blood and interstitial fluid differs from the solute concentration of the fresh water in which it lives.
S		-	1.7.3.1.1.1.4	If there is a higher concentration of nonpenetrating solutes in the surrounding solution, water will tend to leave the cell, and vice versa.
S		-	1.44.1.2.1.1.4	However, because these animals differ considerably from seawater in the concentrations of specific solutes, they must actively transport these solutes to maintain homeostasis.
S		-	1.40.2.1.3.5	For example, many marine invertebrates, such as spider crabs of the genus Libinia, let their internal solute concentration conform to the relatively stable solute concentration (salinity) of their ocean environment.
S		-	1.39.4.3.3.1.5	Many plants can respond to moderate soil salinity by producing solutes that are well tolerated at high concentrations: These mostly organic compounds keep the water potential of cells more negative than that of the soil solution without admitting toxic quantities of salt.

A	"extreme cold"	"lower temperatures"
S	"extreme cold"	+	1.7.1.3.1.2	For instance, fishes that live in extreme cold have membranes with a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails, enabling their membranes to remain fluid (see Figure 7.8a).
S	"lower temperatures"	+	1.39.4.3.5.1.6	For example, membrane lipids increase in their proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which have shapes that help keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures by impeding crystal formation (see Figure 7.8a).
S		-	1.7.1.3.1.1	EVOLUTION   Variations in the cell membrane lipid compositions of many species appear to be evolutionary adaptations that maintain the appropriate membrane fluidity under specific environmental conditions.
S		-	1.7.1.2.13.4	Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbon tails, and this makes the membrane more fluid (Figure 7.8a).
S		-	1.7.1.2.13.3	The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see Figures 5.11 and 5.12).

S	"diffusion"	+	1.7.3.6.1	We can now state a simple rule of diffusion: In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated.
S		-	1.7.3.1.1.3	Water molecules move randomly and may cross in either direction, but overall, water diffuses from the solution with less concentrated solute to that with more concentrated solute.
S		-	1.7.3.1.2.8	In the end, the effect is the same: Water diffuses across the membrane from the region of lower solute concentration (higher free water concentration) to that of higher solute concentration (lower free water concentration) until the solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane are equal.
S	"diffusion"	+	4.1462.1.1	A diffusion is the spontaneous movement of a substance down its concentration gradient, from a region where it is more concentrated to a region where it is less concentrated.
S		-	1.36.3.3.2.5.2	Because water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, the more negative pressure potential at the air-water interface causes water in xylem cells to be "pulled" into mesophyll cells, which lose water to the air spaces, the water diffusing out through stomata.
S		-	1.16.3.15.2	This type of interphase chromatin, visible as irregular clumps with a light microscope, is called heterochromatin, to distinguish it from the less compacted, more dispersed euchromatin ("true chromatin").
S		-	1.50.5.2.2.7	Thus, the action potential generated by specialized cells in one part of the heart spreads to all other cardiac muscle cells, causing the whole heart to contract.
S		-	1.7.3.7.2	When a substance is more concentrated on one side of a membrane than on the other, there is a tendency for the substance to diffuse across the membrane down its concentration gradient (assuming that the membrane is permeable to that substance).
S	"Diffusion"	+	4.1470.1.1	Diffusion of CO2 across cell membrane is the passive movement of carbon dioxide from an area of high concentration on one side of the membrane to an area of lower concentration on the other side of the membrane.
S	"diffusion"	+	4.1471.1.1	A diffusion of oxygen across plasma membrane is the passive movement of oxygen from an area of high concentration on one side of the membrane to an area of lower concentration on the other side of the plasma membrane.

S		-	1.45.4.2.2.4.4	Aldosterone, in turn, stimulates cells in the kidneys to reabsorb sodium ions and water from filtrate, raising blood pressure and volume.
S		-	1.44.4.3.4.2.1	The main function of kidneys in marine bony fishes is to get rid of divalent ions (those with a charge of 2+ or 2-') such as calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sulfate (SO42-').
S		-	1.26.6.2.2.2	Because ribosomes are fundamental to the workings of the cell, rRNA genes have evolved so slowly that homologies between distantly related organisms can still be detected: making these genes very useful for determining evolutionary relationships between deep branches in the history of life.
S		-	1.25.4.2.2.2.5	Even so, it is clear that losses to date have not reached those of the "big five" mass extinctions, in which large percentages of Earth's species became extinct.
S		-	1.7.4.3.3.1	What we know about cotransport proteins in animal cells has helped us find more effective treatments for diarrhea, a serious problem in developing countries.
S		-	1.50.5.1.3.4.3	Prolonged contraction can result in muscle fatigue due to the depletion of ATP and dissipation of ion gradients required for normal electrical signaling.
